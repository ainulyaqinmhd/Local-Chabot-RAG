https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/transition-analytics-to-manage-growing-climate-risks/,GRESB’s Asset Impact team launches new product for asset managers and owners to better manage growing transition risks and meet net zero requirements and targets,"Amsterdam & Paris, July 9 — The Asset Impact team at GRESB is delighted to launch Transition Analytics, a specialized product designed for asset owners and managers to better manage transition risk, engage their portfolio companies with detailed insights, and meet their varied environmental commitments and reporting requirements. Transition Analytics provides users with the world’s most comprehensive asset-based emissions and activity database for 11 of the most emissions-intensive sectors – linking more than 148,000 physical assets to 3,000 listed companies with ownership stakes in these assets, along with their 32,000 listed and private subsidiaries. The absolute emissions and physical emissions intensity data – covering the current year and forecasted up to 2029 – enables asset managers and owners to gain a deep understanding of the climate impact derived from their portfolios. With Transition Analytics, users can set bottom-up sectoral targets in line with international guidelines, such as those from the Net Zero Asset Owner Alliance or Net Zero Asset Manager Alliance; efficiently meet climate-related reporting requirements, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR); and strategically allocate capital and manage future transition risks. “Asset managers and owners that are paying attention understand the business risks associated with climate change and are working hard to integrate them into their existing frameworks to minimize potential losses,” says Vincent Jerosch-Herold, GRESB’s Chief Product Officer for Asset Impact. “Our goal is to empower these institutions with the data and insights they need to protect their investments and decarbonize their portfolios from the bottom up.” Key features of Transition Analytics: Granular data and indicators: offering absolute emissions, physical emission intensities, and activity values across 11 climate-critical sectors Flexible aggregation levels: providing company-level, sector-level, and exposure-level data, ensuring maximum flexibility for reporting and target setting Forward-looking insights: allowing users to stress-test investment strategies up to 2029 Seamless integration: using identifiers and classifications like LEI, NACE, and ISINs as well as FactSet for easy company matching and hassle-free integration into existing systems Affordable and ready-to-use: reducing the burden of data processing and reporting, this accessible product is updated quarterly for continuous accuracy “Our solutions are already helping leading institutions like Barclays, BNP Paribas, and MassMutual navigate a complex and fast-moving environment,” says Michel Amar, Chief Business Development Officer for Asset Impact at GRESB. “With Transition Analytics, asset managers and owners with an eye on sustainability can also benefit from a streamlined set of advanced climate metrics and emissions forecasts. This will facilitate profound opportunities and strong wins for asset managers ready to lead in the climate space.” To learn more about Asset Impact’s new asset-based data solution, please click here. ### ENDS ### Media Contacts Tyler GuthrieDirector of Communications, GRESB[email protected] About GRESB & Asset Impact Asset Impact is a suite of GRESB products that support the financial sector to assess and quantify the climate impact of investments using an asset-based approach.

(For a refresher on the approval process, please revisit the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap.) During its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board approved the first changes to the 2025 Real Estate Standards, which adjust scoring weights for residential real estate portfolios and aim to more accurately reflect indicators that are inapplicable or less/more material to the residential sector. Standards Development GRESB has received important feedback about the evolution of the Standards from stakeholders around the world, highlighting a priority on the speed and direction of Standards development. In response, the GRESB Foundation Board has unanimously voted on the development of a plan to guide the 2025 Standards development. The plan will include increased acceleration and more thematic transparency. Additional details will be shared in the 2025 Roadmap, which will be published in the fall.

Through a compelling thought experiment, they illustrate the differing effects of these investment strategies on capital impact, concluding that capital flowing to brown portfolios in any region would have a much larger impact than a comparable investment in already-green assets.

Building certifications: How to impose an expiration date Green building certifications are crucial for assessing sustainable design and performance in real estate. However, since varying global certification schemes complicate this for investors and asset managers, the GRESB Foundation made building certifications a focal point in the 2023 Standards development process, leading to significant updates in 2024. This acknowledges the enduring relevance of certifications, between those issued recently and those awarded over a decade ago.GRESB’s Alodie McLaren, Senior Associate for Real Estate, outlines the need for this update and the implications of it for our members on reporting requirements.

In April, we hosted a webinar about Aotearoa New Zealand’s Climate Standards. Ngā mihi nui to our incredible panellists: Lisa Hinde from Precinct Properties NZ, Kate Gunthorp from Westpac New Zealand, and Bobby Shen from NZGBC. Our key takeaways: There are no returns on a dead planet – sustainability isn’t just an add-on that costs time. The Standards ensure consistent financial risk disclosure for companies, but the message needs to be tailored to the appropriate audience. Investing in the transition is just that – an investment, not a cost. Downstream impacts and potential losses are regularly underestimated. Sustainability needs to be considered holistically, as it will affect everyone on many different levels.

What we’ve been talking about The second quarter of 2024 was a true triathlon for the GRESB Oceania team, swimming to attend various industry events, cycling to deliver webinars, and running to hold masterclasses. Besides the excellent NABERS + CBD Conference (congrats to NABERS on their 25th anniversary) and GBCA’s insightful Green Building Days, we managed to take part in the following events: Investor Masterclass Just as Gianmarco Tamberi and Mutaz Barshim shared their gold medal in the High Jump at the Tokyo 2020 Games, our case study presenters at the Investor Masterclass were all gold medallists to us. Bringing together existing and prospective GRESB Investor Members from across 20 different organisations, the return of the Investor Masterclass format in May was a major success. Our key takeaways: Investors actively engage with their managers using GRESB data to assess and encourage alignment with best practices in ESG. There is an ongoing shift from investors away from simply looking at the scores in the GRESB Assessments – actual ESG performance, including the delivery of positive outcomes, is becoming more crucial over time. Investors are increasingly seeking asset-level performance data to engage managers about on-the-ground performance. Bummer, I missed it! Investor Members can contact us for the summary notes. RIAA Conference We witnessed another record-breaking performance by the RIAA team at their annual Australia conference. Our key takeaways: A lively panel discussion about offsets had Dr Megan Evans talking about the risks of ACCUs and explaining that offsets should be expensive to incentivise carbon abatement, versus business as usual. Prof the Hon Gareth Evans AC KC encouraged us to focus on the geopolitical issues most salient for responsible investors and to value our “reputation for decency”. Joe Longo, ASIC Chair, reminded us that misleading and deceptive conduct has never been acceptable, but environmental factors are now coming to the fore with greenwashing. According to Pablo Berutti from Stewart Investors, transparency itself does not build trust. What builds trust is saying clearly what you’re going to do and then actually doing it. It’s all about accountability. Darn it, I missed it! Check out RIAA’s LinkedIn feed for summaries of the sessions. ULI Asia Pacific Summit GRESB Lead Asia Representative, Yvonne Huang, represented team GRESB at the ULI Asia Pacific Summit in Tokyo this month. Our key takeaways: Learn by doing: Cecilia Tse from Aon New Zealand highlighted that aligning with TCFD and ISSB simplifies compliance and strengthens climate roadmapping. Collaboration is key: Calvin Lee Kwan from Link REIT urged everyone to share data and best practices to create a clearer risk management picture. Keep it simple: Mark Cameron from Nuveen recommended a focus on clear communication and engaging young talent. Gosh darn, I missed it!

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-customize-peer-group-functionality/,New “Customize Peer Group” functionality available,"(This post was originally published in June 2023 and has been updated with new information.) In 2023, GRESB real estate participants had access to a new “Customize Peer Group” functionality in the GRESB Portal. This new feature was made available in a test phase, developed in response to industry feedback. It allowed participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as allocated by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. In 2023, updated peer group selections did not appear in Benchmark Reports, but participants could access rankings against a Customized Peer Group in the GRESB Portal. Thanks to continued member feedback, we are pleased to offer an improved Customize Peer Group functionality in 2024, which will appear in the Benchmark Reports. What you can expect from this functionality In 2024 The 2024 Benchmark Report will include both the ranking against the GRESB predefined peer group and the ranking against the customized peer group. In order to incorporate a customized peer group into the Benchmark Report, the “Customize Peer Group” functionality will be available only from August 1 to 15. Non-listed participants will now be able to see their peers and will be able to add or remove non-listed fund managers from their customized peer group. Users will see improved usability of the functionality based on user feedback. In 2025 The Benchmark Report will primarily rely on the customized group and all benchmarking insights will be calculated based on it. Please note that specific updates are subject to change, as we are continuing to collect feedback from participants and investors to further integrate insights from the Customize Peer Group functionality in future Benchmark Reports. For questions about the new “Customize Peer Group” functionality, please contact the GRESB Helpdesk. Step-by-step guide 1) Log into the GRESB Portal In the Assessment Portal, you will see a new assessment status called “Customize Peer Group.” Please note that only users with an Account Manager access level can confirm or customize an entity’s peer group. 2) Review your predefined peer group Clicking this new status will redirect you to an overview of your entity’s peer groups, as predefined by GRESB. The methodology used is described in the Reference Guide, Appendix 3B. Entities that submit all three Components are assigned to two peer groups – one for Standing Investments and one for their Development portfolio. Users will be able to confirm and/or customize both peer groups individually. If you’re satisfied with the predefined peer group, you can confirm it by clicking the “Confirm Peer Group” button. This action can be completed only once. If you change your mind and want to submit edits, you can do so by clicking the “Customize peer group” button and follow the steps below. 3) Customize peer group If you want to change peer group allocation, click on “Customize Peer Group”. You will be redirected to an overview page of all characteristics that can be modified. It’s pre-filled with characteristics used to define your initial peer group. You can add or remove characteristics. This year, participants can make any selection they wish, even selecting characteristics that are different from their own entity. Listed entities will also be able to select and deselect individual listed participants from their final peer group composition. Participants can confirm their peer group if the characteristics chosen result in six or more entities for that group. This process can be completed multiple times during the month of August until the participant is satisfied with their final peer group selection. Participants will also be able to submit feedback on the functionality and suggest further improvements."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/government-owned-power-generation-portfolios-hinder-progress-towards-eu-climate-goals/,"Government-owned power generation portfolios hinder progress towards EU climate goals, new analysis finds","Amsterdam, June 3, 2024 – New analysis from GRESB’s Asset Impact team on the EU power sector reveals that governments, as the ultimate owners of a significant share of the largest power-generating assets in the bloc, are not accelerating away from fossil fuels fast enough to meet their own 2030 climate goals. The report, Power Players: Ultimate Ownership, Emissions, and Slow Progress in the EU Power Sector from 2024 to 2030, complements the European Central Banks’ landmark study early this year into the misalignment of bank portfolios with climate transition, which relied on Asset Impact’s data in its analysis. This new report by GRESB highlights that: The EU power sector is heavily concentrated: just 20 companies are ultimately responsible for almost 40% of the sector’s total emissions Among the 20 largest generators, a striking 88% of power generation is ultimately attributable to national and local governments Based on currently planned activities, the EU will still use coal and gas to supply 5% and 20% of its electricity, respectively, in 2030, which is misaligned with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 Emissions (NZE) Scenario and the bloc’s own climate goals One of the most striking insights from the new analysis is that many of the ultimate parent companies of EU power assets are not companies at all, but governments. In fact, among the 20 largest generators, 85% of power generation is attributable to national governments, with local governments owning a further 3%. At first glance, these leading national government generators appear to be green giants – with most of the electricity produced in 2024 being from low-carbon sources and less emissions intensive than the sectoral average. (The top 20 generators account for 43% of total generation but only 31% of total emissions.) However, looking at individual ultimate owners in more detail, a nuanced picture emerges. Non-hydro renewable power – primarily solar and wind – is only a significant contributor to the portfolios of four governments: that of Sweden (17%), Denmark (77%), China (29%) and Ireland (21%). At the other extreme, coal and gas dominate the government-owned portfolios of Poland (89%), Germany (90%) and Ireland (70%). Reliance on coal means that Poland’s government is the single largest emitter in the EU, releasing 48.6 MtCO2e in 2024, nearly double that of the next highest emitter, the French government – which has a much larger generation portfolio and a much lower average emissions intensity, owing primarily to its massive nuclear fleet. While this is not surprising given historical dependencies and current capabilities, the laggards will increasingly become isolated and under pressure as others accelerate. Looking into the data we see many positive signals showing a sector in transition: Total emissions are projected to decline by one-third (about 5% per year, annualized) between 2024 and 2030, with almost all top emitters decreasing their emission intensity by 2030. Coal will decline by 60% over the next six years and renewable energy generation will double. “These projections are promising; however, the continued reliance on fossil fuels undermines much of the progress that is being made,” says Alex Clark, Research Director for Asset Impact at GRESB. “With coal and gas still supplying 5% and 20% of electricity, respectively, across the EU in 2030, the sector will not be on track to meet the IEA’s NZE Scenario, which requires net zero electricity emissions by 2035. To reach zero by this date and to stay on track with the IEA’s scenario, total emissions in the EU need to decline more than twice as fast as they currently are over the next six years and coal needs to be completely phased out.” The current trajectory – based on our forward-looking projections using evidence of companies’ actual capex plans, rather than stated assumptions – suggests that governments could and should exert additional direct pressure on the companies they control in the power sector to accelerate decarbonization efforts in line with the bloc’s stated objectives and the IEA’s NZE Scenario. “The slow pace of change we observe from our data will have, as the ECB shows, significant implications for banks with exposure to high-emission assets. To avoid a growing degree of financial, reputational and legal risk, banks must ensure their lending portfolios in the power sector are consistent with climate goals. This requires granular data and rigorous, analytical methodologies,” says Noémie Klein, Chief Impact Officer at GRESB. It is clear from the data that, ultimately, the EU will only achieve its ambitious climate goals if the whole sector gets on track. ### ENDS ### To access the report click here. Media Contacts Tyler GuthrieDirector of Communications, GRESB[email protected] Notes to editors: The scope of our analysis includes power plants located within the EU (i.e. the Euro area plus Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and Denmark). Most, but not all, of the power plants in these countries are owned by EU-domiciled companies. We still include non-EU companies with shares in EU assets because foreign companies are not exempt from the EU’s local legislative requirements. We predominately use generation figures because capacity is not a reliable indicator of actual electricity produced given large differences across different power sources. Our forward-looking projections are based on evidence of companies’ actual capex plans, rather than simply assuming they will meet their stated targets. About GRESB & Asset Impact Asset Impact is a suite of GRESB products that support the financial sector to assess and quantify the climate impact of investments using an asset-based approach. With a focus on the most energy-intensive sectors, Asset Impact links carbon emissions of physical assets to corporate ownership trees, from direct owners to parent companies and the securities they issue. The database encompasses 366,000 physical assets tied to over 66,000 public and private companies, representing more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to historical and current emissions data, Asset Impact’s solutions integrate capital expenditure plans and commissioning and decommissioning schedules, providing a comprehensive outlook until 2030."

Global investors expand ESG engagement in APAC For the fourth consecutive year, a group of global investors, in collaboration with GRESB, has increased their coordinated efforts in the Asia Pacific region to engage with the real asset industry on significant ESG disclosures and net-zero strategies. This year’s campaign has expanded to include infrastructure companies for the first time, in addition to listed real estate companies and REITs, resulting in an engagement rate higher than ever before. “It’s great to see global investors using the weight of capital to encourage companies to improve their management of ESG issues. In turn, this can enhance investee companies’ financial performance and the long-term performance of investment portfolios,” said Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. Read more about the collaborative engagement campaign in our press release here. GRESB AP now available The GRESB Accredited Professional (GRESB AP) program, designed to empower professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in sustainability reporting within the real assets industry, is now available. Open to GRESB Members, Participants, Partners, and individuals seeking to expand their knowledge in sustainability reporting, the GRESB AP credential will equip you with the expertise to understand, report, and manage sustainability data and performance within the GRESB Real Estate Assessment.

Foundation update Foundation stakeholder engagement The Foundation continues to actively engage with stakeholders through in-person and virtual meetings, as well as through a quarterly newsletter. The new newsletter includes updates on the Standards Committees as well as content, tools, and engagement suggestions relevant to Investor Members. If you are an Investor Member and would like to sign up to receive the investor newsletter, please email [email protected]. In March, we hosted a social sustainability roundtable in Sydney and recently an Investor Masterclass, which included presentations by APG, Hesta, NSW Treasury Corporation (TCorp), and VFMC, in addition to another Social Sustainability Roundtable in London last week. If you would like to receive updates on our social sustainability efforts, please email [email protected]. The next Investor Masterclass (virtual and in-person) will take place in London on Wednesday, June 26. 2025 Standards workplan The Real Estate (RESC) and Infrastructure Standards Committees (ISC) have begun to endorse the first proposals for changes to the 2025 GRESB Standards, which are then brought to the Foundation Board for approval. (For a refresher on the approval process, please revisit the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap.) During its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board approved the first changes to the 2025 Infrastructure Standards: introducing data coverage across key metrics and standardizing Scope 2 GHG emissions reporting. The ISC is hopeful these two proposals will help to tackle key issues for the GRESB Infrastructure Standards, including: Creating score differentiation for top performers Moving towards scoring performance rather than disclosure Increasing data quality There is still an immediate opportunity for Investor Members to participate in the public consultation on building certifications, which will support the revision of building certification criteria and ultimately affect the scoring of each certification scheme within the GRESB Real Estate Standard. Standards Committee members in-person meeting The Standards Committees will host their first in-person meetings this month. We are pleased the majority of RESC and ISC members can attend the event, and GRESB hopes to find ways to connect in person in the future. During the in-person gathering, both committees will host an extended version of their usual meetings, during which they will continue to work through their 2024 workplan. They will also participate in a joint committee networking session alongside the entire Foundation Secretariat and the Foundation Board chair.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-joins-international-alliance-to-further-drive-built-environment-change/,GRESB joins international alliance to further drive built environment change,"Amsterdam, May 22, 2024 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments, is excited to announce that it is joining the existing international alliance between the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the UK-based Building Research Establishment (BRE), and the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA), to further collaborate and drive change in the built environment. In total, the alliance is expanding with four new partners: Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), GRESB, the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), and the CRREM – Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM). To mark this partnership milestone, the alliance will be publishing a guide, “Financing Transformation: A Guide to Green Building for Green Bonds and Green Loans”, to showcase how verification and certification schemes can meet global sustainable classification frameworks and support the 1.5°C climate trajectory. GRESB’s Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Chris Pyke, commented that: “GRESB recognizes green building as an important tool to inform institutional investment in real assets. The new guide will help increase the social and environmental impact of capital invested in green bonds and loans.” To further consolidate the bolstered alliance and officially mark the publication of the guide, the alliance will hold an event entitled “Uniting the global built environment to drive climate action” during London Climate Action Week on June 27, where leading voices for sustainable development will convene to discuss, among other diverse topics, the role of the built environment in addressing the accelerating challenges of climate change.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/global-investors-expand-engagement-on-esg-and-gresb-participation-in-apac-region-to-include-infrastructure-companies/,Global investors expand engagement on ESG and GRESB participation in APAC region to include infrastructure companies,"Amsterdam, May 22, 2024 – Global investors are expanding their coordinated efforts in the Asia Pacific region to engage with the real asset industry on material ESG disclosures and net-zero strategies. Building on the success of past years, this year’s collaborative engagement campaign extends its focus to include infrastructure companies for the first time, alongside listed real estate companies and REITs. This year, GRESB collaborated with 16 global investors with more than USD 5 trillion in assets under management to engage a select group of listed real estate and infrastructure companies across the APAC region. Through active stewardship and engagement, investors encourage real asset companies to participate in GRESB. This allows them to assess alignment with best practices on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues alongside the GRESB Standards, enabling them to identify leaders while encouraging improvements for those that are lagging. “It’s great to see global investors using the weight of capital to encourage companies to improve their management of ESG issues. In turn, this can enhance investee companies’ financial performance and the long-term performance of investment portfolios,” said Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. The engagement rate has surpassed 50% in 2024, reflecting a significant increase from 40% in 2023 and 25% in 2022. More than 30 out of the 59 target companies have indicated interest in the investor-based campaign, signaling a rapid climb up the ESG maturity curve by regional companies. The inclusion of listed infrastructure companies in this year’s campaign has been a resounding success, highlighting the widening scope and impact of ESG-focused engagement across different sectors and asset classes. “By speaking to companies with a unified voice, investors can more effectively communicate their responsible investment beliefs to investee companies. The result is a more informed and constructive dialogue, leading to a stronger commitment to disclose and improve ESG practices by listed real asset companies,” Langbroek continued. Investors who supported the collaborative engagement campaign in 2024 include: About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven, industry-led organization providing standardized and validated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) data to financial markets.

The annual GRESB benchmarks include more than 2,000 real estate portfolios and funds as well as more than 170 infrastructure funds and nearly 700 infrastructure assets, collectively representing USD 8.8 trillion in gross asset value."

For now, let me wish everyone a smooth and productive GRESB reporting period. Regards, Tom Idzal GRESB Head of Americas Arcadis on SEC climate rule & ESG regulatory evolution While the SEC’s climate-related reporting rule, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, was put on hold just days after it was published last month, it remains an important regulatory milestone in the US, signaling that more – rather than less – regulatory pressure is on the horizon for US-based reporters of all types. Globally, regulation like the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is rapidly taking hold, and many organizations are seeking to align with CSRD and other frameworks like it to ensure consistent disclosure to stakeholders, regardless of geography. At Arcadis, we expect the SEC rule to follow a similar trajectory. While scaled back from its original ambition, and currently facing legal challenges, it remains an indicator of what is to come for reporting organizations on this side of the Atlantic. Read Arcadis’ summary of the SEC rule here.

Nareit Leader in the Light Update Since 2012, Nareit has awarded REITs across several property sectors a Leader in the Light Award based on their GRESB Scores from the Real Estate Assessment, and a supplemental submission evaluating their organizational strategies and performance. The GRESB Real Estate Assessment will continue to be the basis for the annual Leader in the Light Award. However, this year, the supplemental submission will be completed separately from the GRESB Assessment. To participate in the Leader in the Light Award program, Nareit members must complete both the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the separate supplement, administered by Nareit. Once all sections of the GRESB Real Estate Assessment are completed and the supplement submitted to Nareit, participants will automatically be included in the Leader in the Light Award competition. Leader in the Light Awards will be presented in November at REITworld.

General Atlantic will acquire its stake from existing shareholder Summit Partners, which will retain a minority position in GRESB following close of the transaction. GRESB intends to partner with General Atlantic to support its next phase of growth through strategic expansion and product innovation and to accelerate impact across financial markets. Founded in 2009, GRESB provides sustainability standards, benchmarks, and actionable insights for real assets. General Atlantic’s majority investment and partnership are a testament to the alignment of vision and shared values between the two organizations. With this investment, GRESB will remain an independent Benefit Corporation, expanding its support to a global community of real asset investors, managers, and partners. The affiliated not-for-profit GRESB Foundation will continue to provide industry-led strategic direction and governance over the GRESB Standards. The GRESB management team will reinvest into the company and continue its ongoing work driving GRESB’s growth and impact. General Atlantic’s investment aims to allow GRESB to expand its work on transition finance, fixed income, the REAL Solutions family of services, and more. Sebastien Roussotte, Chief Executive Officer, GRESB, commented, “GRESB looks forward to contributing to BeyondNetZero’s vision for climate action powered by technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This vision underpins GRESB’s industry-led approach to creating global standards that increase market transparency and accelerate the clean energy transition.” Rhea Hamilton, Managing Director at General Atlantic’s BeyondNetZero, said, “GRESB has established itself as the industry standard for benchmarking across real assets. With buildings and real estate accounting for 40 percent of global greenhouse emissions, data is key to unlocking the opportunity to deliver net-zero, resilient assets. We believe GRESB’s management of asset-level data and compelling value proposition deepen the Company’s position as an enabler of decarbonization for investors and asset managers. We share GRESB’s conviction in accelerating the global transition to sustainable real assets and look forward to partnering with the Company’s mission-driven team.” Tom Hussey, Principal at General Atlantic, continued, “GRESB delivers standardization and comparability across the real assets ecosystem, encouraging all participants to measure and improve ESG credentials. We believe that the Company is backed by long-term tailwinds as decarbonization and ESG benchmarking become core metrics for LP portfolios. We intend to leverage General Atlantic’s expertise at the intersection of innovative data, technology, and climate solutions to support GRESB in its continued expansion and product development.” “We have been proud to work alongside Sebastien and the entire GRESB team to support the company’s significant growth and expansion over the last four years,” said Johannes Grefe, Managing Director at Summit Partners. “We believe GRESB’s commitment to providing industry leading ESG data and benchmarking solutions will continue to play a pivotal role in driving sustainable investment practices worldwide,” added Chris Bon, Principal at Summit Partners. GRESB benchmarks and insights are generated from data self-reported through annual assessments for standing real estate investments, real estate projects in development, infrastructure funds, and infrastructure assets – both operational and in various stages of development. Each year, GRESB publishes global aggregated benchmark data that highlight the state and continued progress of ESG in the industry. The GRESB Standards, upon which its benchmarks are based, evolve over time based on input from industry representatives who sit on and work with the GRESB Foundation. This ensures that assessments are guided by what investors and the industry consider to be material issues and that scores reflect evolving sustainability expectations. Through its assessments, benchmarks, and related products, GRESB enables investors to make more informed decisions; empowers companies, managers, and asset operators to improve their sustainability rating through ESG insights and best practices; and encourages the wider real assets industry to embrace and promote ESG transparency and collective action. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals. Moelis served as financial advisor to Summit Partners, and Milbank served as legal advisor. Weil Gotshal and De Brauw acted as legal advisors to General Atlantic.

What we’ve been talking about We’ve been talking with many of you about several big-picture topics this month including, but certainly not limited to: Thank you to our Partner, JLL, for hosting our GRESB Foundation Roundtable. We brought together representatives from more than 30 different Real Estate and Infrastructure Participant Members and Partners for a lively discussion about the future of the GRESB Standards. Our key takeaways: We discussed key areas of development such as net zero, materiality, building certifications, indicator retirement, and Like-for-Like scoring Challenges include balancing the needs of different stakeholders across the real asset industry and ensuring high data quality Related to emissions calculations, we discussed the ability to normalize for climate zones and occupancy rates Homemade Dutch brownies are now a tradition for formal GRESB stakeholder engagement events Bummer, I missed it! If you were unable to attend and would like a fuller summary of the discussion, drop me a line and I can share the summary notes with you. We were delighted to co-host a packed room for a roundtable on the topic of investor engagement with social sustainability, alongside our Industry Partners GBCA and IWBI. Our key takeaways: “Being a jerk isn’t good for business anymore” You can’t capture the complexity of social value/impact through metrics alone. It’s also about storytelling Nevertheless, investors do require comparability Data is good, but you need to be incredibly transparent about the methodology of how you collect, measure, and assess social value/impact Darn it, I missed it! Get in touch and I’ll share the follow-up when available. As per the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap, the Foundation is exploring the concept of sectoral materiality in the Real Estate Assessment, beginning with the residential sector. Many thanks to our GRESB Investor Members who took the time to discuss this concept with our colleague Charles van Thiel, Director, Real Estate. It was fantastic to see so many friendly faces at GBCA TRANSFORM and to have our Chief Innovation Officer, Chris Pyke, on the main stage as a speaker. Our highlights: The incredible and complex interaction of First Nations communities with nature and ecology — how centering cities with First Nations-led design can help us live better as part of nature In the world of regulations, we need to ensure that standards are aligned with the green building movement. If not, we might get dragged under the train Untrashing the world through sustainable sunglasses truly is possible Holy moly, I missed it! Look out for conference-related content on the GBCA website. Thank you to our new Industry Partner, MECLA, for the invite to their roundtable session discussing the role of the finance sector in supporting the decarbonization of the built environment with a primary focus on reducing embodied carbon. What you can read or listen to After you finish the Easter egg hunt, break the fast at Eid al-Fitr, or await your Passover celebrations, make sure to check out: In The complexity of defining and measuring social value, I wrote about why investors are increasingly demanding reliable social impact data, prompting real estate management entities to intensify efforts to gather, report, and analyze such indicators. Hassell and GBCA have come together for a discussion paper, Social Value in the Built Environment. We loved that it brings together global and Australian work about social value to raise awareness and that it is a very accessible document. GBCA is keeping itself busy and released a discussion paper, A nature roadmap for the built environment. The paper evaluates environmental risks and opportunities pertinent to the industry, explores innovative concepts for nature regeneration, and clarifies the collaborative roles required.

Current criteria provide a large number of schemes with full recognition and limited information to inform scoring and analysis. Therefore, the Real Estate Standards Committee (RESC) is collaborating with industry stakeholders to: Elevate best-in-class schemes, encouraging broader adoption within the industry Refine the list of accepted schemes, recognizing those with the greatest credibility and impact Enhance transparency on key evaluation metrics, informing investment decision-making Learn more about the public consultation and sign up to provide your feedback here. Infrastructure Standards Committee (ISC) update The ISC has recently discussed the importance of data coverage, agreeing on the need to develop changes to reward coverage across all key performance metrics in 2025. Understanding data coverage levels allows data consumers to make more informed management decisions while also opening the door to developing other insights and comparisons over time and between entities. Furthermore, the Committee unanimously agreed on the need to standardize Scope 2 reporting across all reporting entities and will score location-based reporting while also allowing for the option to report market-based values. This approach provides consistency across all reporting entities, while also acknowledging the importance of market-based efforts from infrastructure actors. GRESB Foundation update The Foundation Board recently hosted its annual in-person meeting in London and the overarching theme was “Savvy investors look beyond the simple GRESB Score.” To provide investors with value beyond a simple numerical score, the Foundation is discussing how to: Reduce reporting burden to help GRESB Members efficiently address their regulatory and voluntary data demands Provide decision-useful information to investors to better inform the ongoing dialogue with managers Mitigate against greenwashing to support the efficient flow of capital toward sustainable assets A critical part of this effort involves improving communication with Investor Members, who have recently begun receiving a quarterly update from the Foundation.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-announces-public-consultation-on-building-certifications/,GRESB announces public consultation  on building certifications,"Background Since its inception, the GRESB Standard has recognized building certifications as a valuable proxy for management and performance. High quality certifications serve as an additional layer of transparency to investors, distinguishing spaces and facilities that have received third-party recognition for sustainability efforts. In the last decade, the building certification landscape has significantly evolved and expanded, resulting in an ever-growing number of available schemes covering a wider variety of ESG topics. At the same time, the scope and significance of the GRESB Standard continue to adapt to fast-changing expectations from institutional investors. The GRESB Foundation has asked the Real Estate Standard Committee to review the current situation, including engaging with key stakeholders, collecting feedback, and potentially developing new criteria to accept and score building certifications. The GRESB Real Estate Standard The GRESB Real Estate Standard applies several evaluation criteria to recognize and score building certifications schemes. Current criteria provide a large number of schemes with full recognition and limited information to inform scoring and analysis. In response, the GRESB Foundation requests stakeholder feedback to develop new building certification evaluation criteria that will: Feedback process The feedback process offers GRESB stakeholders the opportunity to review and comment on a revised list of criteria drafted by the GRESB Foundation via a public consultation. Input will be solicited from three groups of stakeholders: Group 1: Participant Members and Industry Partners Group 2: Partners and other key stakeholders Group 3: Investor Members Each stakeholder group will be consulted over a two-week period, and the criteria will be refined and updated using feedback from each group. Investor Members will be the last group consulted in the process, offering them the opportunity to review the criteria that incorporate feedback from other groups. The final criteria will subsequently be provided to the Real Estate Standard Committee for their consideration. They may elect to accept, reject, or request revisions to the new criteria. If needed, the Real Estate Standard Committee may refer them to the Foundation Board for a final decision. Subject to changes by the committee or board, the new criteria will be published in October 2024, in an effort to be effective for the 2025 Real Estate Standard. Timeline The consultation process will last approximately ten weeks, from April-June 2024. Specific milestones are provided below: April 15: Secretariat shares the first draft criteria with Group 1. April 15-28: Consultation period opens for Group 1. May 6: Revised draft criteria shared with Group 2. May 6-19: Consultation period opens for Group 2.

It was developed in response to the evolving needs of institutional investors and managers seeking deeper insights into the sustainability of individual assets,” said Roxana Isaiu, Chief Product Officer at GRESB. “This represents a decade-long commitment to understanding, measuring and benchmarking the real-world performance of investor-owned assets worldwide.” Powered by aggregated asset-level data derived from GRESB’s annual real estate assessment, REAL Solutions encompasses actionable information on targets, operational performance, building certifications, energy ratings and efficiency measures, equipping investors and managers with the right tools to understand and improve asset performance. In-depth asset-level insights and benchmarks for managers REAL Benchmarks is the first tool available from the REAL Solutions product family, which will be released in April. Designed for real estate managers and listed companies, REAL Benchmarks offers a customizable dashboard to privately and securely analyze the contribution of each individual asset to portfolio performance. The tool allows users to compare all or a filtered set of portfolio assets against a series of performance benchmarks derived from the GRESB database. “REAL Benchmarks represents a leap forward for fund managers seeking comprehensive insights into their real estate portfolios. Recognizing the need for accurate asset-level data and tailored benchmarks to inform meaningful decisions within the portfolio, REAL Benchmarks empowers decision-makers to understand and optimize the performance of individual assets, ultimately driving positive environmental and financial outcomes,” said Sebastien Roussotte, Chief Executive Officer at GRESB. REAL Benchmarks will be available year-round and seamlessly updates whenever data is edited in the GRESB Asset Portal. Over time, the dashboard will incorporate new functionalities for advanced analysis and simulation. Setting the bar for sustainable investor-owned real estate In addition to delivering actionable benchmarking insights for managers, REAL Solutions is setting the bar for sustainable investor-owned real estate – providing unprecedented insights into the performance of the best real estate across the globe. Drawing on an aggregation of the measured, real-world performance of investor-owned property from the GRESB database, REAL Solutions shows median consumption for: Energy: Industrial, 64.4; Office, 152.6; Residential, 120.4; Retail, 214.5 (kWh/m2) Water: Industrial, 120.4; Office, 327.2; Residential, 1,073.9; Retail, 524.2 (liter/m2) Waste: Industrial, 3.5; Office, 3; Residential, 7.9; Retail, 8.9 (kg/m2) Notes to editor: GRESB will be releasing more detailed global benchmark figures in the coming weeks and months. REAL Statistics for financial institutions Developed specifically for financial institutions, REAL Statistics is a global dataset covering energy and GHG intensity values and trends. When launched, REAL Statistics will provide aggregated asset-level ESG data points that are organized into 11,000 unique combinations of property type, electricity grid, location and climate zones. Subscribers to REAL Statistics will be able to select from a range of performance indicators, including average, median and key thresholds, such as the top 15% of assets. The data is aggregated and not attributable to individual assets, funds or companies. Learn more about REAL Solutions at gresb.com/REAL-Solutions.

As highlighted in the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap, the real estate topics include building certifications, biodiversity, diversity, equity and inclusion, embodied carbon, net zero, physical climate risk, and sector specificity. The infrastructure topics include a solution for infrastructure under development, biodiversity, data coverage, diversity, equity and inclusion, net zero, physical climate risk, supply chain, and verification and assurance. An updated Foundation Roadmap will be published later this year. Foundation roundtables Both the real estate and infrastructure work plans include data coverage and social sustainability as priority topics. As such, the Foundation has continued to host roundtables on these topics this month. One will be hosted in New York City and another is slated to be hosted in London on Tuesday, February 13 just before the 2023 Regional Insights – London event. As highlighted in the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap, the Foundation recognizes the importance of collecting market feedback from participants and other stakeholders, so we will continue to plan these regional events around the world to ensure the evolution of the GRESB Standards is informed by the industries’ perspectives.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-unveils-new-office-in-london-uk/,GRESB opens new office in London,"GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments, is excited to announce that it has opened a new office in London, United Kingdom. The latest location further expands GRESB’s regional presence, following the recent opening of a hub in Paris, France. The office will grow GRESB’s operations and better serve members in the United Kingdom and the wider EMEA region. GRESB is headquartered in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, with regional teams on the ground to support the organization’s growing membership. This includes investors, managers, and partners in North America, Asia, and Oceania. GRESB is committed to supporting data-led ESG insights globally through its Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments, as well as across its suite of broader ESG solutions, services, and asset-level insights. GRESB in London GRESB’s London office, located in the City of London at 68 King William Street, will allow GRESB to increase its support to UK-based investment managers and investors. The location is well-positioned for the London team to meet its members in person, facilitating additional engagement and assistance. The landmark building is located at ‘the gateway to the City’, directly outside of Monument London Underground Station and the improved Bank Station entrance. This prime location provides excellent public transport connectivity and is situated in close proximity to associated regional train stations at Cannon Street and London Bridge respectively. The office space is operated by London-focused office provider Halkin. In 2023, GRESB expanded its London-based team, bolstering its representation of the Member Relations function in the UK. These changes aim to enhance GRESB’s customer support and member engagement through dedicated resources. A London base will improve members’ access to GRESB expertise throughout the year and reporting cycle. Additionally, it will provide an enhanced ability for GRESB to host regular in-person meetings with the dedicated GRESB account management team as well as tailored regional events. Alex Steel, Manager, Member Relations for the UK and EMEA states that “having an office in London is key to supporting our members in such a critical market. UK-based funds represented 13 percent of the Real Estate Benchmark and 26 percent of the Infrastructure Benchmark in 2023, therefore engaging, advising, and listening to our participants in this location is crucial to driving more sustainable real estate portfolios and harvesting key insights to help evolve the Standards. We anticipate that the London office will bring about new opportunities for GRESB and our members moving forward.” GRESB is confident that the new London office will bring added value to our members, partners, and UK-based staff. We look forward to welcoming you to our new base very soon. To get in touch with the London office, please contact one of our GRESB regional representatives."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-launches-carbon-footprint-dashboard-equipping-investors-with-energy-consumption-and-ghg-emissions-data-for-real-estate-portfolios/,"GRESB launches Carbon Footprint Dashboard, equipping investors with energy consumption and GHG emissions data for real estate portfolios","Amsterdam, January 24, 2024 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments, announces the release of the Carbon Footprint Dashboard. This interactive tool marks a significant step in empowering GRESB’s real estate investor members with extensive insights into their portfolios’ energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Powered by asset-level data, the Carbon Footprint Dashboard offers real estate investors a comprehensive view of the energy usage and GHG emissions within their GRESB portfolios, enabling them to make informed decisions that benefit both their investments and the planet. The tool allows investors to visualize and analyze data on a country and property sector basis, filling in any data gaps through GRESB’s industry-leading estimation model. This, in turn, can also aid investors in meeting disclosure requirements. Reported energy and GHG emissions data can vary significantly across property sectors and assets, creating a critical data gap for investors worldwide in calculating their portfolio’s carbon footprint. Notably, according to GRESB data, the hotel and office sectors report the highest percentage of building-level energy consumption data across property sectors, at 89% and 85%, respectively. In contrast, the residential and retail sectors present lower figures at 61% and 52%, respectively. Consequently, investors in these sectors encounter substantial challenges in determining their portfolio’s carbon footprint due to incomplete data. GRESB’s new dashboard addresses this issue by enabling investors to accurately estimate missing data using GRESB’s Estimation Model, ensuring complete coverage across energy and GHG data and providing investors with a holistic view of their carbon footprint. GRESB’s Estimation Model uses known building data points—such as floor size, location, and property subtype—to generate highly representative estimations from a global database of over 170,000 assets within the GRESB benchmark. “GRESB is dedicated to supporting investors in their sustainability journey. The launch of the Carbon Footprint Dashboard reinforces our commitment to providing invaluable tools that drive positive environmental impact within the real estate sector,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO at GRESB. The Carbon Footprint Dashboard aligns with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology, ensuring that investors can calculate their share of energy consumption and GHG emissions according to globally recognized standards.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-iwbi-announce-new-strategic-partnership/,GRESB and IWBI announce new strategic partnership,"In December 2023, GRESB and the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) announced a strategic partnership to accelerate social sustainability by elevating reporting and disclosure capacities related to crucial social indicators, such as health, well-being, and equity. Given the fluctuating regulatory landscape, both investors and companies are increasingly driven to address social sustainability, representing the “S” in ESG. As defined by the UN Global Compact (UNGC), social sustainability is the process of identifying and managing all types of business impacts on people. Social sustainability frequently correlates with commercial opportunities and risks facing real asset investors and managers. Integrating a stronger emphasis on health, well-being, and equity within sustainability reporting will bridge the divide in existing ESG frameworks regarding social sustainability. The IWBI-GRESB partnership aims to assist investors, fund managers, and companies in advancing social sustainability by: Pioneering resources to aid investors, companies, and asset operators embed social performance into the investment engagement process Co-producing a social sustainability dashboard with performance measures utilizing data from the GRESB Real Estate Assessment Convening key stakeholders to delve into the best practices and reporting frameworks addressing the social components relevant to social sustainability Supplying accompanying materials to aid investors in leveraging information and key insights from the GRESB and IWBI social sustainability reports and tools Since 2013, the IWBI has developed the WELL Standard, the leading global framework for scaling health across buildings, organizations, and communities. Backed by more than 7,000 scientific studies, the WELL Standard outlines key building-level interventions and organizational strategies across ten categories: air, water, nourishment, light, movement, thermal comfort, sound, materials, mind, and community. In 2024, the WELL Standard is used in over 125 countries, by more than one quarter of the Fortune 500 companies, and across 4.9 billion square feet of real estate.

I am proud to lead such a critical part of GRESB and support the Foundation’s mission to drive sustainable value through effective communication between institutional investors and managers. The work that goes into ensuring a functioning GRESB Foundation requires countless hours (sometime in the middle of the night) of commitment from more than 100 individuals around the globe. I owe tremendous gratitude to the Foundation Board, the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, the Working Groups, and the Expert Resource Groups. These volunteers are the lifeblood of the Foundation. They ensure the GRESB Standards remain independent, investor-led and reflective of the real asset industry, and each of them contributed to the Foundation’s successes of 2023. Over the course of the year: We created twelve months of newsletters, countless articles and even podcasts, which reached the eyes and ears of thousands of people around the world We hosted town halls and round tables around the globe to elevate and explore the concepts that are most important to our stakeholders We continued to advance and improve the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards, keeping up with the rapidly evolving real asset industry We shared the findings from the Net Zero Working Groups, which will continue to inform next year’s Standards We elected nearly ten new members to the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees and put them straight to work crafting proposed changes to the Standards We invited several new members to the Expert Resource Group, who have already raised their hands to support our 2024 Standards development work plans We thanked Patrick Kanters for his nearly three-year tenure as the inaugural Foundation Board Chair, where he has played a critical role in ensuring the Board’s continued success After serving on several GRESB committees for more than a decade, we welcomed Katie Jowett as the new Foundation Board Chair We published the Foundation 2024 Roadmap, which will serve as the crucial communication tool between the Foundation and each of you I sincerely hope our accomplishments elevate the importance of the GRESB Foundation and reinforce its vital role in advancing sustainability within the real asset industry. I also hope it is clear to you that the Foundation does that work as an echo chamber. We rely on your input to guide and evolve the standards’ development. You elevate the topics we explore, you inform the questions we ask, and you demand the changes we make to the Standards. Your participation and support are what drives sustainable market transformation. As we embark on another year together, I commit to each of you that you will see and hear from us more, and more importantly, that we will listen and engage with you more. On behalf of the GRESB Foundation, I am grateful for each of you and to your contributions to the standards. I sincerely look forward to engaging with even more of you — GRESB’s invaluable stakeholders — in the years to come. Thank you and happy new year! Sincerely,"

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresbs-2023-in-review-progress-and-milestones/,GRESB’s 2023 in review: Progress and milestones,"2023 has been an extremely productive year at GRESB, marked by the release of important new features and continuous technical improvements to ensure that our investor members, participants, and partners can make the most of their GRESB membership and capitalize on their sustainability efforts. Among the many initiatives carried out in 2023, we are proud to share a few highlights: The GRESB Transition Risk Report underwent important updates twice in the past year: First, in March, when the report was updated with the new CRREM pathways; and more recently, in October, when the report was updated with 2023 data and new functionalities such as percentage of ownership, benchmarking insights, market-based emissions, and much more. In August, GRESB launched a much anticipated “Customize Peer Group” functionality to allow real estate participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as defined by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. The feature was released in test phase and developed in response to industry feedback. GRESB’s investor tools also underwent significant improvements in 2023, with a more user-friendly Data Exporter now featuring multiple filters and a save functionality, and an updated Portfolio Analysis Tool now allowing investors to better customize their analysis and input percentage of ownership, among other enhancements. 2024 will see further improvements and new features, so stay tuned! Additionally, as of late 2023, GRESB’s non-listed Investor Members can now request access to managers’ Transition Risk Report, TCFD Alignment Report, and SFDR Reporting Solution for additional timely insights to inform their investment decisions. Investors can also express interest in these reports to managers who have not yet purchased them. As our regional teams and global footprint continue to expand, GRESB is also creating tailored content and pathways for our regions. In 2023, we launched two new regional newsletters: “GRESB Quarterly, Americas,” and most recently “GRESB Quarterly, Oceania.” In late 2023, GRESB shared the release of a brand-new GRESB Infrastructure Development Asset Assessment to better cater to the needs of assets in the construction or pre-construction phase. The new assessment provides infrastructure assets in development with a way to accurately reflect their overall sustainability efforts using dynamic materiality. Throughout the year, the GRESB Portal saw multiple upgrades and technical enhancements. Users now enjoy a faster experience, with the Portal running twice as swiftly as it did in 2022. Moreover, we have amped up the speed of the Data Exporter and improved the GRESB Third Party validation process, enabling more granular validation while minimizing the risk of human errors. Looking ahead to 2024, GRESB investor members, participants, and partners can anticipate even more innovative improvements, timely products, and enhanced functionalities that will further assist them on their sustainability journey, empowering them to navigate ESG challenges with greater precision and effectiveness.

To make sure you’re aware, up to date, and won’t miss out, we bring you this inaugural quarterly newsletter. We look forward to connecting with you once more before the summer holidays and/or to reconnecting with you in the new year. Thank you for your support, hard work, and collective progress – let’s make 2024 even better and greener! Ruben Langbroek Head of Asia Pacific GRESB Past It has been a busy and engaging time of the year for the global and regional GRESB team: 2023 GRESB Results As you’ll have seen by now, GRESB launched the 2023 benchmark results in October, including our annual public results. Do have a look at our interactive public results pages to discover key trends and developments in ESG for the real asset industry and see who received Regional and Global Sector Leader recognition this year. View the 2023 public results. “Australia’s leaders have played their role in setting high sustainability standards and the rest of the market is now moving at speed. This is how we get sustainability at scale.” – Davina Rooney, CEO, Green Building Council of Australia “Australia and New Zealand again demonstrate global leadership in transparent, credible ESG reporting. With infrastructure’s highly catalytic role in economies, and sustainability a significant predictor of fund returns; the continued growth in participation and performance is positive progress for people, nature and thriving nations.” – Ainsley Simpson, CEO, Infrastructure Sustainability Council “Australian property leaders play an international leadership role in building sustainability. It is heartening and necessary that we remain in the front rank of global innovation and performance in creating sustainable cities.” – Mike Zorbas, CEO, Property Council of Australia Regional Results Events A massive “thank you” to everyone who joined us at our recent GRESB Real Estate results events in Sydney, hosted by Colliers, and GRESB Infrastructure results event in Melbourne, hosted by GHD Advisory. These events offer a great opportunity to connect and celebrate our industry’s progress on best practices in ESG, but also to hear from both industry leaders and those that have just started their green journey. We’d also like to thank the event hosts for their support and all speakers for sharing their valuable insights, including from AMP Capital/Dexus, Cbus Super Fund, Green Building Council of Australia, HMC Capital, Infrastructure Sustainability Council, Melbourne Airport, Scape, State Super, Transurban, and Victoria Funds Management Corporation. View the public results events calendar. GRESB Foundation Roadmap The GRESB Foundation recently published its forward-looking 2024 Roadmap, which reflects upon future priorities for the Standards. It describes key drivers for development and areas of work prioritized for 2024, along with issues under consideration for 2025 and beyond. Read the Foundation Roadmap and let us know what you think about the priority areas. GRESB Present Actually, we already gave you some GRESB presents at our recent events: kazoos and modern-slavery-free chocolate bars. But there’s more: GRESB Team Expansion The GRESB Oceania team just doubled in size: Sarah Blankfield joined GRESB as Manager Member Relations. Sarah most recently worked at Charter Hall as Investor Relations Manager & Sustainability Lead. Prior to that, she worked at the global real estate industry association RICS. Sarah and Ruben are kindly hosted by GBCA at their (very green) office in Sydney International Towers, Barangaroo. Sarah: “I’m excited to represent GRESB in Oceania and to connect and engage with regional GRESB Members and Partners. Feel free to reach out to us for a catch-up on all things GRESB. We’re happy to host you at our Barangaroo office or to come to your office. In case of the latter, you’ll be included in our (unofficial and semi-confidential) GRESB Member Office Index: subjectively rated on key criteria such as quality of coffee, view, and atmosphere. Seasonal bonus points are available for most sustainable Christmas decorations.” Online Town Hall Session | November 29, 2023 | 6pm AEDT Join us for an online presentation and live Q&A on the Foundation Roadmap. We will also dive into the much-anticipated 2024 Standards changes. You can leave your questions on the registration page, which we’ll compile for the Q&A.

In-person GRESB Update & Drinks | Harper Rooftop Bar, Sydney | December 12, 2023 | 4pm AEDT Looking for an informal end-of-year get-together at Sydney’s newest and biggest open air rooftop bar? Like to speak with GRESB reps on the imminent changes to the Standards, the Roadmap, and on opportunities for engagement? Want to meet, greet & toast with GRESB’s Aussies that are normally based out of our Amsterdam HQ? Then join us for a GRESB update & drinks event at Harper Rooftop Bar on December 12, kindly hosted by Pro-Invest. The GRESB Oceania team will be joined by Roli Agrawal, Manager Business Development Investors, and Steven Pringle, Director Member Relations. Also, back by popular demand, a festive season trumpet performance, so make sure to bring your kazoos (we’ll have some left for those that missed out). Christmas attire is optional but strongly recommended. Register here. GRESB Future Besides the obligatory new year resolutions (which are so 2023 anyway), there’s more to look forward to in 2024: In-person & Online GRESB Foundation Roundtable: We will host an in-person GRESB Foundation roundtable session in the week commencing March 11. GRESB’s Chief Innovation Officer Chris Pyke will be in town, and we’ll have our overseas team members joining us virtually to offer updates and allow for a constructive dialogue. You can also join us online, but that does mean missing out on the traditional Dutch homemade brownies we’ll serve. Register here. New Products and Services: We’re working on exciting new products and services that support transparency in ESG and offer you actionable insights. Think interactive dashboards with useful (Christmas) bells and whistles. We can’t disclose too much yet but watch this space as well as gresb.com for more information.

Best, Tom Idzal Head of Americas Measurabl on taking politics out of ESG The issue of climate change has long been a hot button topic across both sides of the political divide in the United States. Until fairly recently however, ESG had broadly managed to stay out of the same firing line. But over the past year, for businesses themselves, the politicization of ESG has created something of a bind. Firms find themselves caught between seeking to comply with investor demands and navigating a growing patchwork of statutes that seek to limit the use of ESG factors in business decisions. With new regulations frequently introduced mandating ESG targets or guarding against mandates, it’s a complex landscape. Read Measurabl’s insights into “Taking politics out of ESG” to learn more.

As a reminder, non-listed investors can also request access to SFDR reports as of mid-October and to SFDR data since May. By engaging with managers on transition risk, TCFD alignment, and SDFR compliance, investors can future-proof their portfolio and receive additional timely insights to inform their investment decisions. The Transition Risk Report uses a manager’s 2023 assessment submission to generate asset- and fund-level insights into your investment’s exposure to climate-related transition risk over time, at both a country and global level. The TCFD Alignment Report also relies on the data submitted by managers as part of the assessment process to produce additional timely insights to help you stay ahead of emerging regulatory and climate disclosure requirements. The SFDR Reporting Solution helps your managers meet the most arduous part of SFDR – reporting on product-level Principal Adverse Impacts – while gaining valuable business insights. How to request access: Step-by-step instructions Checking the status of your request After submitting a request, the status of your request will show as “pending request.” You can track all your access requests in the “Pending access requests” tab. Once a request has been approved/rejected, you will be notified by email. Express interest In addition to streamlining access to these insights, this new process also enables investors to express their interest in viewing the reports to managers who may not have purchased the product(s) yet. We also launched some exciting updates to the Data Exporter and Portfolio Analysis Tool in October to increase their usability.

This service takes place after the results release and provides an in-depth understanding of your GRESB Assessment results, including detailed insight into the validation process and the allocation of points for individual indicators.

This increasing dedication and awareness of data quality demonstrates the commitment of global real assets to transparency and sustainability on a broader scale,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO at GRESB. In 2023, GRESB also increased the granularity of the information it collects on net zero, ranging from net-zero policies to commitments and targets, enabling the tracking of this data for the first time. Key real estate insights Participation in GRESB Real Estate Benchmark jumped by 15% in 2023, growing to cover 2,084 listed and non-listed portfolios representing approximately USD 7.2 trillion of GAV across 75 countries and regions. Growth was particularly strong in Oceania and Asia, while markets like Europe and the Americas continued with steady growth rates. In relative terms, Oceania stood out as the fastest-growing region, recording a sharp 23% year-over-year increase in participation. On a global scale, Europe led the pack with the highest number of new participants, rising from 907 to 1,013. At the market level, the United States recorded the highest number of new participants (up from 380 to 433), while participation in Taiwan increased by 900% year over year, growing from one entity to 10. Average GRESB scores increased by a point to 75 for the Standing Investments Benchmark and by two points to 83 in the Development Benchmark. Net-zero highlights 72% of global real estate participants have a net-zero policy in place, with 93% of participants in Oceania reporting a net-zero policy, followed by Asia and Europe with 78% and 77%, respectively. Despite most participants reporting a net-zero policy, only 56% of global participants have made a public net-zero commitment and 50% have established a net-zero target. Key infrastructure insights The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew to cover 172 funds and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment to include 687 assets across 72 countries and regions. The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers approximately USD 393 billion of GAV at the fund level and USD 1.2 trillion of GAV at the asset level for a total of approximately USD 1.6 trillion of GAV. Facilities in the Infrastructure Benchmark jumped by 15% compared to 2022, increasing from 2,481 to 2,851 across 37 sectors. In relative terms, both Oceania and the Americas displayed the steepest growth, recording 10% and 11% year-over-year increases in participation, respectively. In absolute terms, EMEA remains the most represented region in the Benchmark with more than 350 assets. At the market level, Korean assets increased again this year to include 19 entities, marking a 26% year-over-year increase. Average GRESB scores for assets jumped by four points to 83 and for funds by one point to 83. GRESB Infrastructure Members continue to deepen their data coverage, with an increasing number of participants now reporting on key metrics such as Air Pollution, Biodiversity & Habitat, Waste and Employees engagement. Net-zero highlights 60% of global infrastructure assets reported a net-zero policy in 2023, with Oceania and Europe leading the way with 65% of participants in both regions having a net-zero policy in place. While only 40% of global assets reported net-zero commitments, 60% have already set net-zero targets. At the fund level, 68% of reporting funds have a net-zero policy in place, while 70% have already shared net-zero commitments and 60% set net-zero targets. “Net zero in real assets is not merely a goal, but a necessity. It requires a collective commitment to reduce carbon footprints and drive sustainability in the built environment. GRESB participants stand at the forefront of this movement, actively implementing strategies, setting targets and integrating sustainable practices to accelerate progress towards a net-zero future,” said Roussotte.

GRESB Global Results Event Foundation update Infrastructure Standards Committee updateThe Foundation Board (FB) recently voted to add six new members to the Infrastructure Standards Committee (ISC): Jane Baseby (PATRIZIA AG), Lucinda Callow (DWS Group), Olta Cibuku (Amp), Shali Lingaretnam(Victorian Funds Management Corporation), James Milner-Smith (Neos Networks), and Ruairi Revell (abrdn). The new ISC members represent a diversity of organizations, sectors, and geographies and are joining just in time to offer their perspective on the updates proposed to the 2024 Infrastructure Standards. We are grateful for their commitment to advance the GRESB Standards and, on behalf of the GRESB Foundation Board Chair, Patrick Kanters, the ISC Chair, Katherine Sherwin, and the entire Foundation Board, we are excited to welcome them to the ISC!The FB’s selection decision was very difficult as we received numerous applications from highly qualified applicants. We will continue to accept applications on a rolling basis, so we encourage interested candidates to continue to apply for the Standards Committees by completing this nomination form. We truly appreciate the enthusiasm to support the growth of the GRESB Standards and we will work to engage with all of you as GRESB continues to evolve.IFRS StandardsGRESB applauds the recently released IFRS standards, which represent a milestone for sustainability disclosure. Furthermore, the GRESB Foundation appreciates IFRS’ recognition for the core elements of GRESB’s approach to science-based standards development. Since the new IFRS standards define materiality solely in reference to financial investors, the new S1 and S2 standards will need to be used in coordination with more holistic reporting frameworks, such as GRI and GRESB. To that end, GRESB expects there will be significant overlap between the SASB-based IFRS S1 and S2 standards, given the high alignment with the SASB standard, as well as its real estate indicator objectives/scopes.For more information on the existing GRESB alignments, please review how GRESB aligns with common ESG reporting frameworks.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-ifrs-standards-represent-a-milestone-for-sustainability-disclosure/,New IFRS standards represent a milestone for sustainability disclosure,"This week marked an ESG milestone with the release of the IFRS sustainability disclosure standards. The notion of IFRS S1 and S2 may not immediately spark excitement. However, they are a Big Deal. Their release is the culmination of an intensive, 18-month development process and the consolidation of multiple underlying standards. S1 is envisioned as a “global baseline” for sustainability disclosure — focusing on information that can be “reasonably foreseen” to be relevant to investment decisions. S1 builds on SASB with guidance for industry-specific disclosures. S2 is used in coordination with S1 to focus on climate-related disclosures. S2 fully incorporates and extends TCFD recommendations. It requires industry-specific, material information about climate-related risks and opportunities, including both physical and transition risks. IFRS standards are explicitly designed to integrate with corporate financial statements — matching entities, time periods, accounting assumptions, and other key factors. They emphasize the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on current and anticipated future performance, financial position, and cash flows. Speaking in London at the 2023 IFRS Conference, ISSB Chair Emmanuel Faber said that the new standards provide a consistent, comprehensive language for reporting — one that will be familiar to users of IASB protocols in 140 countries. Faber emphasized that the new standard expands the scope of financial reporting across the value chain. He also articulated three criteria for standards moving forward. According to Faber, standards should be: Equitable Accessible Iterative It is validating to hear that GRESB’s approach to standard development reflects Faber’s criteria: GRESB standards are open and available to all GRESB governance process is transparent and accessible to all stakeholders through the non-profit, industry-led GRESB Foundation GRESB standard development is iterative — adapting and improving every year to meet the changing needs and circumstances of the market GRESB applauds the new IFRS standards, and it appreciates recognition for the core elements of GRESB’s approach to science-based standards development. To this end, GRESB has conducted a series of framework mapping exercises, looking at how the GRESB Standards align with common ESG frameworks and evaluating alignment with nine different standards. The resulting crosswalks can be explored and downloaded here. Particularly relevant to the new IFRS standards, a recent analysis of the SASB standards found high alignment with GRESB, with nearly 80% of SASB’s RE indicator objectives/scopes and underlying content addressed by GRESB. Significant alignment was also found between GRESB Standards and SASB’s Standard, with an overall alignment of nearly 70% (download the alignment review). We expect similar alignment with the new SASB-based IFRS S1 and S2 standards. It is notable that the new IFRS standards remain unapologetically focused on single materiality. This means that their definition of materiality is defined explicitly with respect to financial materiality as defined by IFRS’ concept of “relevance to investors.” This structure was inherited from SASB and it presumes that investors are narrowly focused on balance sheet issues with secondary or tertiary concern about the impacts of running the business. The standards do not require disclosure related to broader social and environmental impacts. This strategy may not align with regional regulatory regimes and it has well documented limitations for issues such as public health. IFRS recognizes that this means that the new S1 and S2 standards will need to be used in coordination with more holistic reporting frameworks, such as GRI and GRESB. Going forward, we celebrate this important milestone, and we recognize its importance in advancing sustainability reporting. We are excited to explore ways to leverage the new standards as we pursue our shared mission of providing timely, relevant, and material information to market participants. Onward!

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/june-newsletter-new-peer-group-selection-functionality-global-results-event-regional-insights-events/,June Newsletter: New peer group selection functionality; Global Results Event & Regional Insights events,"The GRESB Assessments deadline is only a few days away! Please remember to submit your Assessment response before the Portal closes on July 1, 2023. For any questions on the Assessments or for assistance, please contact us. To learn more about what you can expect in the coming weeks and months, please refer to our GRESB Assessment timeline. In the meantime, we have two important updates on a new peer group selection functionality currently being developed and our 2023 results events below. New “Customize Peer Group” functionality Starting August 1, 2023, GRESB real estate participants will have access to a brand new “Customize Peer Group” functionality in the GRESB Portal. This new feature, available in 2023 in test phase, is being developed in response to industry feedback and allows participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as allocated by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. Because this functionality is still being developed, your updated peer group selection will not appear in your 2023 Benchmark Report. However, your input will allow us to build the functionality in a way that accounts for as many real-life use cases as possible. In October, as a gesture of appreciation for your input, you will be able to access your ranking against your Customized Peer Group in the GRESB Portal. The ranking will be available to participants only. Participants will also be able to provide feedback on the usability of the functionality, which will be critical to improving the functionality for its 2024 release, when it will also appear in the Benchmark Reports. Available between August 1 and August 30, the “Customize Peer Group” process takes less than five minutes to complete and comprises only a few simple steps. Learn more about it here. 2023 GRESB events The 2023 GRESB Results events series is right around the corner!

The link between GRESB participation & financial performance As sustainability continues to gain prominence in the real estate industry, investors and fund managers are increasingly recognizing the potential impact of ESG practices on financial performance. Leveraging two recent studies, we shed light on the interplay between GRESB participation and non-listed real estate fund returns in Europe and in the US. Read key findings. Foundation update Introduction to new GRESB staff Chris Pyke and Sarah Welton recently joined the GRESB team and have begun supporting the work of the Foundation Board. Chris is returning to GRESB as the Chief Innovation Officer and he will lead GRESB’s innovation strategy across all aspects of the organization. Sarah will serve as the Foundation and Stakeholder Engagement Director and will act as the key interface between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV. CRREM In September 2022, GRESB released the preliminary 2022 GRESB Real Estate Benchmark Reports, including a new “Portfolio Decarbonization” section, showing a portfolio’s performance against the CRREM pathways. In response to this new section, the Foundation solicited feedback from global industry organizations, including PCA, Nareit, ULI, REALPAC, and ANREV, to request their input on the updated section in the Benchmark Reports. The feedback was reviewed by the Foundation Board during the May Foundation Board meeting and, as a result, an updated CRREM section will be included as part of the 2023 Real Estate Benchmark Report and an updated version of the 2022 CRREM section will also be released in the coming weeks. The two most notable changes to the 2022 re-release are the removal of “stranding year” terminology and updated “limitations” language. 2024 Standards review In its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board continued its review of the proposed changes to the 2024 Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards, scheduled for release in late October. There are several topics being considered by the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, all of which will be presented to the Foundation Board for final approval. The real estate topics include residential real estate, energy consumption and performance, building certifications, TCFD alignment, physical climate risk and transition risk. The infrastructure topics include a solution for infrastructure under development, TCFD alignment, and GHG performance. It should be noted that the topics of net zero, embodied carbon, and biodiversity are already in progress (please refer to the May 2023 update for more details) and diversity, equity and inclusion will likely be prioritized after the 2024 Standards are released.

Foundation update TCFD alignment on climate-related opportunities Earlier this month, the GRESB Foundation Board approved the first changes for the 2024 Infrastructure Standards, including the alignment of Physical Climate Risks (PCR) and Transition Risks (TR) with TCFD-related indicators. These updates had been previously endorsed by the Infrastructure Standards Committee and include changes to better integrate climate-related opportunities into the Standards to align more closely with the TCFD framework. This includes an update to an existing indicator, two new indicators, and the introduction of scoring across three indicators. Total scoring in the risk management section will remain unchanged, and the total points will be reassigned across indicators.

This includes an update to an existing indicator, two new indicators, and the introduction of scoring across three indicators. Total scoring in the risk management section will remain unchanged, and the total points will be reassigned across indicators. Embodied carbon The GRESB Foundation has approved a new indicator on embodied carbon for the 2023 Real Estate Standard. This change will encourage the collection of embodied carbon data as part of carbon accounting and commitments. Embodied carbon emissions data will be collected from New Construction assets and Major Renovation projects separately, alongside the life cycle stages and building layers included in the entity’s embodied carbon analysis for assets/projects completed during the reporting year. For more information, read our recent GRESB Insights article on what is embodied carbon in the real estate sector and why does it matter. Biodiversity Biodiversity has been deemed an issue of importance by both Standards Committees, but it was also recognized that the issue is not as mature as other topics, and therefore not as high a priority as Net Zero, DEI, and Physical Climate Risk. As further context, the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was launched in 2022 with an initial version under consultation at the moment and a planned publication of its final recommendations in Q4 2023. It is anticipated that this framework will be adopted by several investors and managers in the future, although the framework is still a work in progress and the practicalities of its implementation are still to be defined. In terms of timing, it means that the earliest reporting year when biodiversity could be incorporated further in the Standards would be the 2025 GRESB reporting cycle. GRESB has engaged an independent consultant to help the Standards Committees evaluate and measure the significance of biodiversity on real estate and infrastructure. A literature review is underway and stakeholder interviews will begin in the coming weeks. Net Zero Working GroupsThe Net Zero Working Groups for real estate and infrastructure have successfully concluded their research and delivered their outputs to the GRESB BV team secretariat. The Real Estate Net Zero Working Group provided a technical examination of different approaches to the assessment of critical net-zero elements, including energy performance, GHG accounting, offsets, lifecycle stages, and data availability. The Infrastructure Net Zero Working Group provided an evaluation of how industry-leading frameworks address various aspects of net zero, including the treatment of Scope 3 emissions, offsets, target-setting, governance, and disclosure.The deliverables have also been shared with the Standards Committees, who will use them to inform the integration of net zero into the GRESB Standards.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/foundation-update-may-2023/,Foundation update – May 2023,"TCFD alignment on climate-related opportunities Earlier this month, the GRESB Foundation Board approved the first changes for the 2024 Infrastructure Standards, including the alignment of Physical Climate Risks (PCR) and Transition Risks (TR) with TCFD-related indicators. These updates had been previously endorsed by the Infrastructure Standards Committee and include changes to better integrate climate-related opportunities into the Standards to align more closely with the TCFD framework. This includes an update to an existing indicator, two new indicators, and the introduction of scoring across three indicators. Total scoring in the risk management section will remain unchanged, and the total points will be reassigned across indicators. Embodied carbon The GRESB Foundation has approved a new indicator on embodied carbon for the 2023 Real Estate Standard. This change will encourage the collection of embodied carbon data as part of carbon accounting and commitments. Embodied carbon emissions data will be collected from New Construction assets and Major Renovation projects separately, alongside the life cycle stages and building layers included in the entity’s embodied carbon analysis for assets/projects completed during the reporting year. For more information, read our recent GRESB Insights article on what is embodied carbon in the real estate sector and why does it matter. Biodiversity Biodiversity has been deemed an issue of importance by both Standards Committees, but it was also recognized that the issue is not as mature as other topics, and therefore not as high a priority as Net Zero, DEI, and Physical Climate Risk. As further context, the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was launched in 2022 with an initial version under consultation at the moment and a planned publication of its final recommendations in Q4 2023. It is anticipated that this framework will be adopted by several investors and managers in the future, although the framework is still a work in progress and the practicalities of its implementation are still to be defined. In terms of timing, it means that the earliest reporting year when biodiversity could be incorporated further in the Standards would be the 2025 GRESB reporting cycle. GRESB has engaged an independent consultant to help the Standards Committees evaluate and measure the significance of biodiversity on real estate and infrastructure. A literature review is underway and stakeholder interviews will begin in the coming weeks. Net Zero Working Groups The Net Zero Working Groups for real estate and infrastructure have successfully concluded their research and delivered their outputs to the GRESB BV team secretariat. The Real Estate Net Zero Working Group provided a technical examination of different approaches to the assessment of critical net-zero elements, including energy performance, GHG accounting, offsets, lifecycle stages, and data availability. The Infrastructure Net Zero Working Group provided an evaluation of how industry-leading frameworks address various aspects of net zero, including the treatment of Scope 3 emissions, offsets, target-setting, governance, and disclosure. The deliverables have also been shared with the Standards Committees, who will use them to inform the integration of net zero into the GRESB Standards.

Tom IdzalGRESB Head of Americas Financing commercial real estate’s net-zero transition with green bonds Focusing on commercial real estate (CRE) decarbonization initiatives, GRESB Global Partner Verdani Partners explores the current green bond landscape and its potential to help finance the net-zero transition. It also discusses the implications of new climate policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and challenges green financing must overcome to maximize positive environmental impact. Key Takeaways: Green bonds have become increasingly attractive for both issuers (i.e., companies) seeking financing for environmental projects and investors seeking to align portfolios with ESG goals. There are three major green bond reporting frameworks or standards: the Green Bond Principles, the Climate Bonds Standard, and the newly agreed upon European Green Bond Standard (currently in development). Commercial real estate companies are well suited to identify climate-focused projects for green bond issuance because many are already centering decarbonization and climate risk management across operations and long-term strategy. The unprecedented level of climate funding offered by the Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to shift demand for climate-focused green bonds. Greenwashing and additionality are two key challenges facing the green bond market. Read the full article here.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/global-investors-push-for-participation-in-gresb-as-common-language-for-esg-across-apac/,Global investors push for participation in GRESB as ‘common language’ for ESG across APAC,"The 2023 collaborative engagement will reach real estate companies in 13 key markets May 9, 2023 – For the third consecutive year, a group of global investors is collaborating in the APAC region on coordinated engagements with the real asset industry to strengthen dialogue on both ESG disclosures and net-zero strategies as well as to make GRESB the ‘common language’ for conversations with investee companies on material sustainability topics. This year’s initiative will focus on encouraging listed real estate companies and REITs to make ESG disclosures in line with the GRESB Standards via participation in the annual GRESB benchmarks. This deepening focus on standardized ESG disclosures and comparable ESG scores is reflected in the most recent end-of-year survey of global GRESB investor members, which found that 70% of those surveyed believe GRESB will be the platform that investees will use to report on their TCFD alignment and related disclosures, in addition to their core ESG management practices and performance. TCFD is becoming increasingly relevant in Asia as more regulatory bodies align their disclosures to the global frameworks. By engaging through GRESB – the common language for ESG disclosures across the globe – investors have a consistent lens through which to track climate-related disclosures and risk management practices over time and to drive improvements where needed. The 2023 collaborative effort is driven by 18 institutional investors representing USD 8.1 trillion of assets under management, including: Aegon AM B&I Capital Bouwinvest Brookfield CenterSquare Cohen & Steers Columbia Threadneedle DWS Heitman JP Morgan Kempen Northern Trust MFS IM Principal Financial Group Quay Global Investors Resolution Capital Schroders Vert Asset Management The GRESB Standards cover the most material ESG issues for real asset investments, as defined by industry stakeholders. The Standards align with other global ESG reporting frameworks, including GRI, SASB, CDP, and the TCFD recommendations. “Sustainability considerations are increasingly important in managing risks and creating value in real estate portfolios. GRESB participation provides stakeholders important insights on how management teams are addressing these factors and positioning real estate portfolios for the future.” – Michael Shoemacher Director, Real Estate Securities, Brookfield. About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated ESG data to financial markets. Established in 2009, GRESB has become the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world, used by 170 institutional and financial investors to inform decision-making. GRESB standards are governed by the independent, not-for-profit GRESB Foundation, while ESG assessments are managed by GRESB BV, a benefit corporation. For more information, visit GRESB.com"

Call for nominations to the GRESB Foundation Standards CommitteesThe GRESB Foundation is seeking new candidates to serve on its Standards Committees for both the real estate and infrastructure industries. In response to high interest from the GRESB community, the Foundation Board has decided to accept and review nominations on an ongoing basis for each Committee, and appoint new members as and when vacancies become available. At present, there are several vacancies in both Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, and the Foundation Board is aiming to start selecting candidates by early May 2023, so please send your application as soon as possible to be considered for this next round of nominations. You can apply by completing this Nomination Form. More information on the call for nominations and the responsibilities of being a Standards Committee member can be found on our website. Shaping the 2024 GRESB StandardsRecent discussions with Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees have focused on planning and developing content to shape the 2024 Standards, as well as looking further ahead to prioritize research for longer-term developments. The main issues discussed for real estate include residential real estate, building certifications, and energy performance, while infrastructure discussions have focused on assets in development as well as closer alignment to TCFD through the integration of climate-related opportunities. Development of the approach to and inclusion of net zero across all Standards, currently in focus through the ongoing Net Zero Working Groups, continues to be a top priority for both committees and will be the focus of upcoming meetings in May. Over the coming months, the Foundation will continue to review, research, and implement plans on a number of these topics in order to finalize content for the 2024 Standards changes. Net Zero Working GroupsThe Net Zero Working Groups for real estate and infrastructure have successfully conducted their first two (out of three) working group sessions, during which topic-focused workstreams within each Working Group have presented and discussed the outcomes and progress of their research. The Working Groups are currently in the process of drafting their respective output documents, which are set to be presented to the corresponding Standards Committees next month. The Real Estate Net Zero Working Group will provide a ledger of the pros and cons of different approaches to net-zero assessment within the industry. The Infrastructure Net Zero Working Group will provide an evaluation of the extent to which various aspects of net zero are addressed in industry-leading frameworks. GRESB eagerly anticipates the final output of the Working Groups, which the respective Standards Committees will review and assess during their meeting in May. The Standards Committees will use these outputs to inform the integration of net zero into the GRESB Standards, which is expected to contribute significantly towards providing clear and contextualized information to the financial industry regarding the net-zero journeys of real assets in the GRESB universe.

Investor member survey findings GRESB recently conducted an Investor Member Survey to explore how investors use GRESB data and how they engage with their managers and portfolio companies.Key findings: The majority of surveyed investors report actively engaging with their managers to request GRESB participation, with one-third of investors requiring mandatory participation.All respondents report having a responsible investment strategy in place, with ESG integration, corporate engagement, and shareholder action being the most commonly used approaches.Around two-thirds of surveyed investors use GRESB results to engage with their managers, and almost half of respondents use the data to analyze the environmental footprint of their portfolio.The vast majority of respondents believe that GRESB will be the platform of choice for managers to report on climate-related financial disclosures and transition risk data View the Investor Member Survey findings. Foundation update Standards Strategic RoadmapSince the publication of the 2023 GRESB Standards changes in October 2022, the GRESB Foundation has continued its work, in line with the new operating model, to review key strategic ESG topics in the GRESB vision, assess main industry challenges, and prioritize topics and action plans for the Standards Strategic Roadmap.The Strategic Roadmap will provide more transparency on the outcome of the Foundation work and prioritization exercise, as well as more visibility into the proposed direction of travel for the GRESB Standards. The Foundation aims to finalize a first version of the roadmap and share it in the near future.Stakeholder engagementThe Foundation also plans to enhance stakeholder engagement and leverage the collective expertise of the GRESB community to help drive the evolution of the Standards. To do this, the Foundation, with the support of GRESB BV, will organize a variety of stakeholder engagements in the coming months, including working groups, consultations, surveys, and more.Net zero has already been recognized by the Foundation as a top priority, and two Net Zero Working Groups, with a focus on real estate and infrastructure, respectively, are currently working on questions that will be presented to the Standards Committees in May 2023. The Foundation may also commission Working Groups on other priority topics, such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion or Physical Climate Risk Assessments.Shaping the 2024 GRESB StandardsAs part of its work in the past few months, the Foundation has identified several more pressing issues that should be the primary focus of the work this year, either to be reflected in the 2024 Standards, or to be researched, specified, and planned in order to facilitate future implementation in the GRESB Standards.In this context, GRESB BV, as instructed by the Foundation, is now focusing on the research and deliverables required to support this shorter-term work. Over the next six months, the Foundation will predominantly focus on reviewing the proposed approaches for the short-term Standards changes and finalize the decisions on the 2024 Standards changes in September.

Highlights include: Infrastructure assets are getting better at setting up ESG policies, plans, systems and disclosureAmong the alternative asset classes, infrastructure is the most transparent in its ESG disclosureAlthough more infrastructure assets are setting GHG emission targets, still less than half have such targets, and very few have a zero target Read the supplement here. To learn more about ESG in infrastructure, watch the “GRESB Inside ESG: GI Hub’s Infrastructure Monitor” webinar, now available on demand. GRESB and GI Hub announced a strategic partnership in August 2022, formalizing an ongoing collaboration between the two organizations to engage a wider array of stakeholders, improve the quality and availability of ESG data and insights and continue building the evidence base for investing in sustainable and equitable infrastructure.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/pcaf-crrem-and-gresb-release-first-version-of-technical-guidance-for-accounting-and-reporting-of-ghg-emissions-from-real-estate-operations/,"PCAF, CRREM and GRESB release first version of technical guidance for “Accounting and Reporting of GHG Emissions from Real Estate Operations”","The jointly developed technical guidance by PCAF, CRREM and GRESB for the accounting and reporting of real estate-related operational emissions has been released today. Cannes, France, 14 March 2023: After intensive public consultation, PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials), CRREM (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) and GRESB have collaborated to release the harmonized technical guidance for the financial industry on “Accounting and Reporting of GHG emissions from Real Estate Operations.” Since decarbonization, transition risk, net-zero target setting as well as GHG accounting and reporting are becoming increasingly important for the real estate sector, a clear guidance on standardized and harmonized accounting procedures related to all aspects of carbon and other GHG emissions is urgently required. The new technical guidance offers this additional clarification and serves as a best practice document with additional specifications to PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry on a range of technical, data and standards issues relating to operational GHG emissions from real estate. This guidance can be used by financial institutions (banks and investors) and, insofar as they require standardized information, their underlying real estate assets, asset managers and companies. In the guidance, the three collaborating organizations clearly set out their recommendations for accounting procedures for both investors and banks, direct and indirect investments, equity and debt, full ownership and joint partnerships, under a variety of consolidation approaches. Main clarifications and key recommendations included in this paper are: Differentiation between corporate GHG accounting and accounting of financed emissionsDifferentiation between GHG accounting for reporting and for other purposes (e.g. transition risk management)Clear definitions for GHG emissions from real estate and differentiation of various categories, including a review of operational carbon vs. embodied carbon in the real estate sectorApplication of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry for real estate, including clarifications on applications related to “Leased Assets” and “Financed emissions” (Scope 3 Cat 13 and 15) Application and clarification on “Operational Control” consolidation approachApplication relationship to TCFDThe importance of capturing all relevant emissions via the whole-building approach Clarification on emissions scope delineation and attribution for various financial actors and boundaries between tenant and landlord emissionsRecommendations for the application of market- and location-based emissions methods, estimation of incomplete data, handling of energy flux measurement, floor space measurement and quality assurance and verification We invite all market participants to apply the new technical guidance and participate in its future development. The document can be accessed here. You can also register to attend a webinar and discussion on the guidance, taking place April 25 at 10:00 CET. About PCAF The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a global, industry-led initiative of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with loans and investments, known as financed emissions. As of February 2023, over 360 financial institutions have committed to the initiative. In November 2020, PCAF published the first-ever Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Financial Industry, which covers the financed emissions of loans and investments in commercial real estate, mortgages, and various other asset classes. PCAF collaborates with several organizations, institutions, and coalitions, including CDP, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA). Contact: [email protected] About CRREM The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) initiative has derived decarbonization pathways that translate the ambitions of the Paris Agreement (to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century) into regionally- and property-type-specific trajectories against which real estate assets and portfolios can benchmark themselves. The pathways and the developed free-ware tool can be used to derive quantitative figures regarding “transition risk” (in this case, the risk of assets being stranded due to regulatory incompliance or market obsolescence). The non-for-profit-initiative is supported by the EU commission, Laudes Foundation as well as APG, PGGM, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). Contact: [email protected] About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data to financial markets. Established in 2009, GRESB has become the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world, used by 170 institutional and financial investors to inform decision-making.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2022-investor-member-survey-findings/,2022 GRESB Investor Member Survey Findings,"In Q4 2022, GRESB conducted an Investor Member Survey to explore how investors use GRESB data and how they engage with their managers and portfolio companies. See the survey results and takeaways below. Key Findings A significant majority (75%) of surveyed investor members report actively engaging with their managers to request participation in the annual GRESB assessments, with approximately one-third of investor members requiring mandatory participation.All survey respondents report having a responsible investment strategy in place, with ESG integration and corporate engagement and shareholder action emerging as the most commonly used approaches.Around two-thirds of surveyed investor members use GRESB results and benchmarks as an engagement tool with their managers, and almost half of respondents use the data to analyze the environmental footprint of their overall portfolio.The vast majority of respondents believe that GRESB will be the platform of choice for managers to report on climate-related financial disclosures and transition risk data. Participation The survey features responses from 42% of the GRESB investor member base, for a total of 61 respondents. The majority of respondents represent investor members with access to the real estate dataset and with headquarters in EMEA. Responsible Investment Strategy All survey respondents report having a responsible investment strategy in place, with ESG integration and corporate engagement and shareholder action emerging as the most commonly used approaches. The majority of respondents also believe that insight gained from GRESB helps them achieve their responsible investment goals. GRESB Portfolio Coverage The survey shows that GRESB portfolio coverage for investor members is comparatively higher for real estate than it is for infrastructure. Engagement with Managers The survey largely demonstrates a high level of engagement between investors and managers, with 75% of investor members actively engaging with their managers to request participation in the annual GRESB assessments. Of these, 53% encourage voluntary participation and 44% incorporate mandatory participation in their agreements. Of those who make participation mandatory, the majority also sets specific targets regarding the GRESB performance of their investments. The majority of investors feel that they receive enough support from GRESB to increase participation across their portfolio. The survey also reveals that the most common challenges identified by managers regarding their GRESB participation are tied to managers’ resource constraints and costs. GRESB Membership Most investors report joining GRESB because of the alignment of the framework with their responsible investment principles and because it helps them engage with their managers. Specifically, GRESB results and benchmarks help investors understand where their investments stand and monitor how managers are managing ESG risks, opportunities, and impact. The survey also highlights that access to peer benchmarking information distinguishes GRESB from other benchmarking platforms, according to 59% of respondents. In addition, 36% of respondents also find that industry endorsement distinguishes GRESB from other benchmarking platforms. Investor Member Tools Out of all investor member tools and core products, respondents rated the Benchmark Report the highest, with the Portfolio Analysis Tool (PAT) and the Data Exporter receiving a rating 0.4 points lower than the Benchmark Report. The most frequent feedback received from respondents regarding the PAT is that it is most insightful when investors’ portfolio coverage is sufficiently high. Additionally, the potential reason why the average rating for the investor member tools is neither particularly high nor low could be attributed to the fact that many respondents indicated that they don’t use all of the tools. New Products: TCFD and Transition Risk The vast majority of respondents believe that GRESB will be the platform of choice for managers to report on climate-related financial disclosures and transition risk data, with respondents in the Americas largely endorsing the TCFD Alignment Report and the Transition Risk Report. On SFDR (the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation), survey respondents highlighted general uncertainty on the degree that GRESB will be the platform to report on product-level Principal Adverse Impacts. This may become more clear now that the first reporting year has started. Learn more about becoming a GRESB member"

GRESB’s first Net Zero Working Groups​​The GRESB Foundation will soon form the first GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Net Zero Working Groups. We will be accepting applications until January 26. So far, we have received great interest from the GRESB community and we thank all of those who have applied or reached out. More information about the scope, timeline, expected outputs, and how to apply, can be found on our website. The GRESB Foundation has recognized net zero as the number one priority ESG topic that needs to be further addressed and scored in the GRESB Standards, making it a key area of focus for 2023. The establishment of Net Zero Working Groups in Q1 2023 is the first engagement GRESB will conduct as part of a broader series of stakeholder engagements throughout the year on this topic. How GRESB aligns with common ESG reporting frameworksThe GRESB Foundation would like to thank the GRESB Partners who contributed to the annual alignment analysis between GRESB Standards and other prominent ESG reporting frameworks. This year, the analysis covered reporting tools from CDP, GRI, SASB, as well as the UN PRI. Assessments are based on the independently owned and governed GRESB Standards, which are reviewed on an annual basis by the GRESB Foundation. This ensures that material ESG issues are addressed and covered by the GRESB Assessments as they develop and emerge. Part of this process is reviewing and mapping other important frameworks and standards to understand where and how the GRESB Standards may align. This annual alignment review may inform prioritization of ESG issues that are considered in the GRESB Standards as well as the approach taken for the technical implementation of any proposed changes. Find out more about the alignment exercise and our partners by visiting our website.

To assist the GRESB Foundation and ensure that the Standards Committees have a clear understanding of how net zero is approached across the real estate and infrastructure sectors, GRESB will conduct a series of stakeholder engagements throughout the year. This will start with the establishment of Net Zero Working Groups in Q1 2023. The first set of Net Zero Working Groups will focus on reviewing the various perspectives relating to net zero in order to facilitate convergence towards a definition for the GRESB Standards and to explore the core assumptions and beliefs that drive divergence in what net zero means and what constitutes a valid journey to achieve it. Joining the first Real Estate and Infrastructure Net Zero Working Groups is a great opportunity for GRESB stakeholders interested in contributing their time, expertise, and experience to help the GRESB Foundation drive the future evolution of the GRESB Standards on net zero. Information about the scope, timeline, and the expected outputs of these first working groups are available below: Real Estate Net Zero Working Group DetailsInfrastructure Net Zero Working Group Details We encourage all who are interested in the GRESB Standards, have the relevant net zero expertise to contribute to the research outlined above, and can dedicate the necessary time from February to May, 2023, to apply. Prior to applying, please review the above details as well as the GRESB Foundation Working Group Terms of Reference.

This past year marked many important milestones for the GRESB community, including: The GRESB Benchmarks grew significantly in 2022, and average scores increased across the board for both real estate and infrastructure. We launched three new resources that can help you on your sustainability journey: The SFDR Reporting Solution, the Transition Risk Report, and the TCFD Alignment Report. This year also marked significant technical improvements to the GRESB Portal to ensure a smoother Portal experience for our members, partners, and participants. The GRESB Foundation established a new Standards Development Process to evolve the GRESB Standards going forward and published the changes to the 2023 Standards in October. We hope you are using this time in December to reflect on what you have accomplished and to set yourself up for success for 2023 by making any preparations that you can early, such as starting the contract renewal process before the end of the year to take advantage of discounted pricing now. Earlier this month, GRESB announced the acquisition of Asset Resolution, an asset-based climate data and analytics provider for financial institutions. The acquisition will expand and enrich GRESB’s asset-level data coverage across hard-to-abate sectors, strengthening its assessments and tools while providing GRESB members with more actionable insights and support with asset-driven analysis. Read the full press release. GRESB Foundation end of year meetings The GRESB Foundation Board and the GRESB BV Supervisory Board held their first annual consultation meeting on November 29, 2022, in accordance with the service-level agreement between GRESB BV and the GRESB Foundation. These meetings discuss the collaboration between both parties in meeting their respective and mutual responsibilities. Agenda points included outcomes of the GRESB Foundation annual self-evaluation process, highlights from the 2022 GRESB results, as well as the 2023 plan for the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV. The GRESB Foundation Standards Committees (SCs) also met in early December to discuss the 2023 priorities and plan, including engagement opportunities with stakeholders. The Foundation secretariat is currently working on adjusting the 2023 plan based on the feedback received from the SCs so that it can be shared with GRESB stakeholders in the new year. GRESB Foundation and the CRREM V2 pathways The CRREM decarbonization pathways are being updated and CRREM recently held a public consultation period to collect feedback. In response to high interest from the Foundation members and GRESB stakeholders on the real estate side, the GRESB Foundation facilitated an information session where CRREM’s managing director, Prof. Dr. Sven Bienert, presented the updated CRREM decarbonization pathways to the GRESB Foundation Board and Real Estate Standards Committee members, who then had the opportunity to provide direct feedback and ask questions. The updated CRREM pathways are expected to be released early next year and GRESB intends to update the Real Estate Benchmark Reports using the updated pathways in Q1 2023. Foundation profiles Our monthly series of Foundation Board Member Profiles aims to give GRESB members and partners insights into the priorities and work of the Foundation and to get to know each Board Member. The profiles provide insights into each member’s motivation for joining the Board, the future of ESG, and how his or her organization approaches responsible investing. Read this month’s Board Member profiles below: Maarten Jennen, Senior Director – Strategist, Private Real Estate, PGGM Mathieu Elshout, Head of Sustainability and Impact Investing, PATRIZIA This year GRESB hosted a record number of events to equip the real assets community with the timely insights they need to achieve their sustainability goals. View our 2022 Events in Review page for a snapshot of the events we hosted in 2022, the topics and geographies we covered, links to event recordings, a list of our event partners, and much more. The year may be almost over, but our events are not! See a list of our upcoming 2023 events and industry events here. Earlier this year, we started a series of case studies that explore the many ways our community uses GRESB, initially looking at how our investor members and managers engage with our data and integrate GRESB into their investment processes and decision-making. In addition, we recently launched a series of interviews focused on the ESG journey of first-year GRESB participants, exploring their motivation for participating in the GRESB Assessments, the benefits and challenges of participation, and the importance of getting started. We hope that the resulting insights can help current and prospective members gain a greater understanding of the broad value found in ESG data and the role that the GRESB assessments can play in supporting organizational goals. Read our first-year GRESB participant interview with Stoneweg US. Read manager case studies. Read investor case studies. Through GRESB Insights, we seek to highlight case studies on ESG integration in real assets, data-driven analyses into how the industry is responding to sustainability challenges, and educational articles exploring topics covered in the GRESB Assessments. The theme this month was “Reflections on 2022.” Below are the latest GRESB Insights: Outcomes of 2022: Strengthening the Link Between Business & Sustainability | WatchWire GRESB 2022 results and CRREM pathways: a call to action | EVORA Global Limited Next month’s topic is “The Future of ESG.” Submission guidelines can be found here.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-foundation-update-events-november-2022-qa/,GRESB Foundation Update Events November 2022 – Q&A,"On November 29 & 30, GRESB hosted two GRESB Foundation Update & 2023 Standards Changes events online. Both events were well-attended and provided a forum for GRESB members and the wider real assets industry to discuss the 2023 Standards changes in detail. Below we share the most salient questions and answers from the events, as well as responses to the questions we were not able to address during the events due to time constraints.You can find more information on the 2023 GRESB Standards changes and related resources here. GRESB Foundation & Standards Is there a start date for when the Working Groups will begin to meet? Pending approval of the 2023 Foundation work plan, the Foundation will establish several Working Groups in 2023. Some of these Working Groups will start operating early in 2023, with the aim to help inform the prioritization phase of the Standards Development process, in which the key topics to be addressed and scored in the 2024 GRESB Standards are identified. Other Working groups may start later in the year and will address topics to be covered by the GRESB Standards on a medium and/or longer term. Announcements regarding the recruitment of Working Group members will be shared soon. Do you plan to have more substantial changes in the years to come? When will these changes be communicated? The GRESB Standards will continue evolving on an annual cycle. However, going forward, the approach will be twofold and split into two interrelated workstreams: Work on the changes for the coming year Work on the strategic direction of the GRESB Standards in the medium and long term. Both workstreams will be based on stakeholder consultation to not only provide an opportunity to input or feedback, but to also allow more visibility and ability to anticipate the changes. The plan is to publish changes to the GRESB Standards early in Q4 of the year preceding their implementation. The medium and long-term strategic priorities will be published in Q1 of each year. When will the 2023 guidance documents be released (Reference Guide and Scoring Document)? GRESB plans to release the 2023 guidance documents early in Q1 2023. Contrary to previous years, the Scoring Document will be released together with the Reference Guide. Is GRESB planning to move to assessing intensities in the future? Moving towards a better recognition of performance is one of the top priorities for GRESB over the next couple of years. This transition to real performance assessment will begin with the start of scoring intensities in the future. Will GRESB further integrate biodiversity issues after 2023? Foundation however recognizes that this issue will need to be closely monitored, in light of the current major developments such as the adoption of the new UN Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022 and how it will frame ESG reporting. As such, the Foundation will continue monitoring the work of the market-led, science based Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and consider the most relevant framework to GRESB stakeholders, with the intention to align the GRESB Standards biodiversity disclosures. Will GRESB include if entities are compliant with the EU taxonomy? Addressing the role of taxonomy compliance in the GRESB Standards has not been an issue that is currently prioritized for review by the GRESB Foundation. The GRESB vision published earlier this year however includes the principle of aligning with, and seeking to influence, relevant frameworks, such as regulatory requirements, and widely adopted reporting standards. Alignment with industry and regulatory frameworks and consideration to sector and regional differences is thus part of the Standards development process and a consideration for any change considered to the standards. What is considered an acceptable net zero policy by GRESB? The GRESB Foundation deemed the existence of Net Zero policy an important element of this update, without imposing a single definition of Net Zero. As with other policies in the Standards, this change does not assess the content of the policy but instead rewards the internal commitment to Net Zero shown by establishing a policy. The provided evidence must demonstrate the existence of formal policy document(s) that address(es) net zero and not simply a list of general goals and/or commitments. Overall, all requirements outlined for the other policy indicators need to be met for the evidence for the Net Zero policy as well. The Net Zero policy does not need to be a standalone document but needs to be at least a separate, clearly distinguished section within a larger policy document. Will the scored climate risk questions require supporting documentation? In 2023, GRESB will start scoring climate risk indicators. In addition, as of 2023 the upload of evidence to support the existence of risk identification and impact assessment processes will be mandatory. Explanations in the open text boxes provided in the indicators are not sufficient but it is required to upload documents or URLs leading to pages explaining the risk identification and impact assessment processes. Further details about the evidence can be added in the specific open text boxes underneath the evidence upload. What evidence will be accepted by GRESB for the Transition Risk indicators? Participants need to provide evidence showing the existence of a formal risk identification and/or impact assessment process. The evidence needs to specifically address each transition risk issue selected (Policy & legal, Technology, Market, and Reputation). Examples of appropriate evidence include, but are not limited to: A document describing the entity’s transition risk assessments or other tangible proof of the entity’s risk assessment activity. Acceptable evidence may include an extract of a procedure undertaken such as register or matrix, checklists, scenario analysis, or a section of a risk management plan addressing transition risks. One-off assessments of transition risk, such as the GRESB Transition Risk Report, can be used as evidence only in combination with further proof of a formal process but for both indicators on risk identification and impact assessment. Please note that the GRESB Transition Risk Report would only enable participants to select the issue “Policy & legal.” The certification of buildings is not sufficient to support the existence of a risk management process. Can you clarify why a lot of the Net Zero additions are simply addressed and not scored? GRESB introduces new topics, such as Net Zero, in the Standards without scoring them in the first year to not cause significant disruptions within the benchmarks and to keep year-on-year comparability as high as possible. Furthermore, not scoring issues/indicators in the first year allows the industry to familiarize itself with the new topics and requirements before factoring it into the Assessment scores. Will GRESB take into account the different national standards when it comes to the gathering of data on waste, electricity, etc.? Local differences are taken into account by GRESB’s peer benchmarking approach. Peer groups are created based on multiple characteristics, including the location of the fund’s assets. By taking the location into account, regional differences are considered in the Assessment. In case local regulation limits data collection for participants, they are not penalized compared to their peers as all are subject to the same local regulation. How will GRESB’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) standard address country nuances in terms of racial diversity (or the absence thereof by nature of overall demographics)? DEI is one of the topics identified as top priority by the GRESB Foundation and one of the new working groups starting next year will discuss this issue and its implementation in the GRESB Standard in more detail. Regional differences and the accounting of them will be part of this discussion. For now, the GRESB Peer Group benchmarking approach will provide comparable results to all participants taking into account the location. What does it mean for an asset to be “exposed”? When an asset is exposed, is the whole fund consequently also exposed? How are you going to rate this? In the context of the GRESB Assessments, “exposure to physical risk factors” refers to the situation in which an asset is located in a spot at which a specific physical risk factor (e.g., flood, hurricane, drought) is expected or modeled to occur. This may differ from the financial definition of “exposure.” So, while an asset may be exposed to droughts, for example, the financial exposure could be very low if the asset has excellent water reuse systems in place. As described in materials provided, identified exposure to particular physical risk factors is not rated/scored in the Assessments. Rather, only that the entity has a systematic procedure for identifying exposures to physical risk factors. Quantified absolute measurement of physical climate risk is a highly complex topic for which we have not yet specified a methodology. However, physical climate risk is a prioritized topic by the GRESB Foundation and will be addressed by one of the working groups set up for next year. What are the requirements for “Dedicated employee(s) for whom DEI is a core responsibility”? To be eligible to report a dedicated employee for whom DEI is a core responsibility, this person must have work tasks specifically related to DEI. It is not required that this person has a specific DEI-related job title as long as DEI is part of the core responsibilities of the employee. Pending approval of the 2023 Foundation work plan, the Foundation will establish several Working Groups in 2023. Some of these Working Groups will start operating early in 2023, with the aim to help inform the prioritization phase of the Standards Development process, in which the key topics to be addressed and scored in the 2024 GRESB Standards are identified. Other Working groups may start later in the year and will address topics to be covered by the GRESB Standards on a medium and/or longer term.

The plan is to publish changes to the GRESB Standards early in Q4 of the year preceding their implementation. The medium and long-term strategic priorities will be published in Q1 of each year. GRESB plans to release the 2023 guidance documents early in Q1 2023. Contrary to previous years, the Scoring Document will be released together with the Reference Guide. Moving towards a better recognition of performance is one of the top priorities for GRESB over the next couple of years.

It is not required that this person has a specific DEI-related job title as long as DEI is part of the core responsibilities of the employee. Infrastructure How will GRESB take into account the impact of assets in addition to their performance? GRESB currently enables infrastructure assets to report on social value in the indicator “Output and impact.” There are currently no widely established frameworks to measure impact, which is why this is not currently a scoring metric in the Asset Performance Component. We are initially moving to better measuring and rewarding performance and will look at further including impact following that. With regard to the Infrastructure Asset Assessment, the GRESB List of Changes says that “The overall scoring weight of GH1 remains the same. Participants who report a Net Zero target will receive 20% of the maximum score for GH1. The overall score is dependent on materiality. This score is reweighted by removing 10% of the total available for the indicator from both ‘Reporting-year target’ and ‘Future-year target’.” Is this going to apply to participants whose primary sector is “Renewable Power”? Yes, assets who fall under the “Renewable Power” sector will also be subject to the scoring changes. For these assets, it means that 60% of the available points for GH1 are awarded for completing data for the metric “Emissions avoided: Reporting-year performance,” 10% for “Emissions avoided: Reporting-year target,” 10% for “Emissions avoided: Future-year target,” and 20% for answering and completing the mandatory information for the sub-question: “Does the entity have a GHG emissions reduction target aligned with Net Zero?”. Note that if you select yes, you will need to provide baseline and end years and indicate to which scope the net zero target applies. GRESB currently enables infrastructure assets to report on social value in the indicator “Output and impact.” There are currently no widely established frameworks to measure impact, which is why this is not currently a scoring metric in the Asset Performance Component. We are initially moving to better measuring and rewarding performance and will look at further including impact following that.

Note that if you select yes, you will need to provide baseline and end years and indicate to which scope the net zero target applies. Real Estate Will GRESB include embodied carbon as an issue for operational buildings? GRESB is already addressing Embodied Carbon as part of the 2023 changes (please refer to the 2023 List of Changes) and a clear direction has been given by the Foundation that the issue should be researched for further development in the Standards. The focus here is first the development of new buildings but increasing the scope of embodied carbon assessment in the future will be part of the upcoming research in this area. How will GRESB factor the purchase of RECs in scoring? GRESB is changing the requirements for reporting renewable energy and aligning the GRESB guidance relating to Renewable Energy with the Scope 2 Quality Criteria of the GHG Protocol to only reward participants for actively procuring renewable energy and no longer for solely being connected to a grid that receives a portion of its energy from renewable sources. One way to actively procure renewable energy is by purchasing RECs. To be eligible for reporting the renewable energy in the GRESB Assessment, the participant must have purchased all of their RECs for the consumption of the reporting year and legitimately retired them prior to reporting the data in the GRESB Assessment. What are the implications of the new reporting boundary requirements? GRESB is changing its reporting boundary requirements in 2023. In previous years, entities could exclude assets with an ownership stake of below 25% from their reporting scope. As of 2023, participants have to report all assets that they have any ownership stake in. This change will have an impact on the aggregation of all indicators reported at the asset level (RA2-RA5, EN1, GH1, WT1, WS1, BC). The percentage of ownership will be used as a weight in the aggregation of the asset-level data up to the property sub-type level. Furthermore, the percentage of ownership will be used in the aggregation of the property type used for the creation of the Peer Group. Will the 2023 GRESB Standards adopt the CRREM-Decarbonization Pathways in any assessment questions and is there a collaboration between GRESB and CRREM? The list of 2023 Assessment changes is final and there will be no further changes to the 2023 GRESB Assessment. Addressing net zero performance will be a topic of further discussion with the GRESB Foundation for future developments of the GRESB Standard. As part of this work, GRESB is in close contact with CRREM. Will there be any further data reporting requirements at the asset level besides the ones already specified? Specifically around the new Waste data guidance. GRESB will not introduce any additional data fields in the Asset Spreadsheet and the changes in 2023 will be limited to the ones already disclosed in the 2023 List of Changes. Therefore, there is no additional granularity required in reporting waste data. Will GRESB take into account that new assets cannot implement efficiency measures? The efficiency measure indicators are used to provide additional context to the provided consumption data. If a new asset is built including specific efficiency measures, these can still be reported. For DEN 2.1: As on-site low carbon technology will be considered with the changes in 2023, does that mean that, for example, if I have a 100% on-site low carbon tech (air source heat pumps) installed that it would possibly score a full point? Is there any space to fill in a breakdown of various types of low-carbon technology? Please refer to the Scoring Document. Each reported renewable energy source or low carbon technology has a weight of 1. The portfolio coverage is subsequently used as a multiplier. Hence, if a participant installed renewable energy sources or low carbon technologies in all their assets, i.e. 100% portfolio coverage, the participant would receive a full score for the indicator. It is possible to report ‘Other’ answers. In the field for ‘Other’ answers, it is possible to report multiple answers. For TC6.2, “Does the entity monitor its impact on the community?” – Livability Score and Walkability Score are cited as options. Does GRESB have any examples of what would be an appropriate example of such scores, if this indicator required an evidence upload? Livability and Walkability Scores are predefined metrics that are calculated in a standardized way. Please refer to the common definitions for these metrics to calculate them. In case these metrics are measured, participants are able to report accordingly in the Assessment. There is no evidence requirement for this indicator. GRESB is already addressing Embodied Carbon as part of the 2023 changes (please refer to the 2023 List of Changes) and a clear direction has been given by the Foundation that the issue should be researched for further development in the Standards.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-acquires-asset-resolution/,"GRESB acquires Asset Resolution, deepening ESG data and insights for global investors, managers and financial institutions","AMSTERDAM, December 5, 2022 – GRESB BV, the global ESG benchmark for infrastructure and real estate investments, today announced the acquisition of Asset Resolution, an asset-based climate data and analytics provider for financial institutions. The acquisition will expand and enrich GRESB’s asset-level data coverage across hard-to-abate sectors, strengthening its assessments and tools while providing GRESB members with more actionable insights and support with asset-driven analysis. Asset Resolution’s customers, which comprise many of the world’s largest banks and consultancies, will benefit from the operational, technical and client support provided by GRESB. The business support provided by GRESB will also help enable the Asset Resolution team to further engage with external research groups and accelerate product development in support of its mission. The team will also benefit from GRESB’s technical expertise in real estate, infrastructure, ESG assessments and disclosures, sales and marketing. “This partnership is about strengthening the value and product offerings both organizations provide,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “We provide complementary services and share a common mission to equip financial institutions with the tools and insights needed to drive progress towards a more sustainable world. Combining our skill sets and teams means better data and more useful insights for our members and customers.” “This partnership represents an important step toward implementing our vision of a financial system that sets the global economy on a net-zero emissions path,” said Noémie Klein, CEO of Asset Resolution. “Together with GRESB, we’ll go further in harnessing the power of our asset-based approach to develop new data and analytics that support climate action by financial institutions.” Asset Resolution was originally created by, and spun out of, the 2° Investing Initiative France to help financial institutions access the right science-based asset-level data and finally drive progress towards a net-zero future. “When looking at acquisition partners to support the continued growth of the Asset Resolution team, we were focused on how we could enable the most impact,” said Robin Edme, President of the 2° Investing Initiative France board. “GRESB’s mission and focus on sustainability was a natural fit, and we look forward to seeing how both teams will complement each other’s work in the years to come.” As part of the acquisition, the Asset Resolution team will continue working from offices in Paris and Berlin to offer customers its existing suite of company- and asset-level indicators and analytics under the new name “Asset Impact.” The new name was selected because it reinforces the company’s vision of empowering financial institutions to translate asset-level insights into tangible outcomes. While building-level data from GRESB members will not be shared with, or included in, Asset Impact’s suite of products, the combined teams will collaborate on ways to leverage each other’s complementary expertise to provide the real assets industry and financial institutions with more comprehensive tools and resources to help organizations create a more sustainable world. In the first quarter of 2023, the teams will announce more details on staffing and resource investments and product roadmaps. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

The 2023 changes represent the first set of Standards developed by the GRESB Foundation. GRESB New Standards Development Process – Evolving the GRESB Standards Going Forward Evolving the 2023 Standards required the GRESB Foundation Board and Standards Committees to adopt a new formalized process, designed to ensure the independence of the Foundation and the transparency of all decisions. The new process allows the GRESB Foundation, representing GRESB Members and Partners, to fulfil its mission and ensure that the standards remain by the industry, for the industry, and investor led. You can learn more about the new Standards Development Process that is now driving the evolution of the GRESB Standards in this document. This details the working relationship between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB B.V., the different stages and processes that enable the development and implementation of specific changes, as well as the more strategic evolution of the Standards. Changes to the 2023 GRESB Standards – Process and Outcomes 2022 has been a transition year to establish the new GRESB Standards Development Process and for the GRESB Foundation to take on responsibility for setting the GRESB Standards. The key objectives for the 2023 Standards changes were to: Focus on the most pressing issues, as expressed by global stakeholders through live engagement sessions and surveysMaximize the number of changes that could be reasonably achieved in the 2023 Standards Minimize the possible disruptions to participants, providing sufficient advance notice, and allowing participants to adequately prepare and adjust to the changesFollow the new process to prioritize, design, formalize, and validate the changes for 2023 For a detailed description of the implementation of the new Standards Development Process this year and the work done to prioritize key topics, as well as a high-level outline of the design of the changes across all Standards, please refer to this document. 2023 GRESB Standards – List of Changes The changes for 2023 broadly cover Net Zero; Physical Climate Risk and Transition Risk; and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This reinforces that the GRESB Foundation views climate as one of the most pressing issues for enhancement in the Standards in the current period, but also reflects that social elements of the ESG landscape are becoming more important.

Departing GRESB Foundation Board Members Deborah Ng (formerly of Ontario Teachers Pension Plan) and Alison Schneider (formerly of Alberta Investment Management Corporation) resigned from the GRESB Foundation Board due to changes to their employment meaning that they were no longer employed by GRESB members. On behalf of the GRESB Foundation Board and GRESB BV, we wish to thank them for their immense contribution to GRESB as an organization and to the cause of sustainable real assets over many years. Looking back to 2015, Deb and Alison were integral in bringing the infrastructure asset class to GRESB, including founding the inaugural Infrastructure Advisory Board and then launching the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment in 2016. Thanks in no small part to their efforts, participation in GRESB infrastructure has grown every year and by 2022 covered over 160 funds and 660 assets. More recently, their wise counsel helped GRESB establish the GRESB Foundation and governance structure. GRESB is now in a stronger position than ever to continue its mission and realize our shared vision of “Sustainable Real Assets.” Their professionalism, constructive input, key insights, and expert advice have been an example and inspiration to many. Simply put, GRESB would not be where it is today without their incredible support. We wish them every success in their future endeavors. New appointments to the GRESB Foundation Board Shama Naqushbandi, Portfolio Manager, Value Creation & Asset Management, Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at AIMCo and Stéphane Villemain, Head of Sustainable Investment at Ivanhoé Cambridge have been appointed to the Foundation Board, at the last board meeting mid-September.

Join us for one of our global results events to learn more about the process and the expected changes. Earlier this year, we started a series of case studies that explore the many ways our community uses GRESB, initially looking at how our investor members engage with our data. We have now expanded the case studies to delve into how managers across real estate and infrastructure integrate GRESB into their investment processes and decision-making – from engaging with investors and benchmarking their performance against peers to identifying risks and opportunities. We hope that the resulting insights can help current and prospective members gain a greater understanding of the broad value found in ESG data and the role that the GRESB assessments can play in supporting organizational goals. Read manager case studies. Read investor case studies. Through GRESB Insights, we seek to highlight case studies on ESG integration in real assets, data-driven analyses of how the industry is responding to sustainability challenges, and educational articles exploring topics covered in the GRESB Assessments.

GPIF first joined GRESB as an Investor Member for real estate in August 2020 and has now expanded its membership to enhance environmental, social and governance (ESG) management practices across real assets. “GRESB is excited to expand our partnership with GPIF and, together, encourage further ESG data disclosure and promote constructive dialogue with investment managers across the region and the globe,” said Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “GRESB is a for-industry, by-industry organization, and we are excited to work even more closely with GPIF to help the investment industry play a larger role in creating a more sustainable world.” GPIF is the largest public fund investor in Japan and a major proponent of responsible investment and stewardship principles. Their commitment exemplifies why Japan has the highest GRESB participation rate among Asian countries. ESG benchmarking tools allow asset owners to more effectively engage with their investments and drive positive outcomes where they are mostly needed.

These results are not shared with GRESB Investor Members and cannot be used for public communication or engagement. For real estate participants, the 2022 benchmark report includes a new portfolio decarbonization section, which presents the portfolio’s alignment with pathways developed by CRREM. This analysis is based on the most current CRREM pathways (September 2022), which are expected to be updated in early 2023. More information about this analysis is included in the benchmark report. Final 2022 assessment results, rankings, and benchmarks will be released on October 3, 2022. At this time, participants will be welcome to privately share their results internally and with investors, but we ask all participants to delay public communications (news releases and social media posts) until October 17, 2022, 23:59 PST when GRESB will release aggregate results to the media. The Review Period is open from September 1 through September 15 The Review Period is an opportunity for participants to officially request a formal review of their preliminary results prior to the release of final results in October.

The participant can then correct their response and resubmit their Assessment. Note that newly-inputted data is subject to validation and – in all cases where the Assessment is reopened – a fee will be invoiced, which is explained in detail in the Portal.

The GRESB Foundation thanks the Property Council of Australia and the Green Building Council of Australia for their generous help in hosting this session. The objectives of this session were to inform about the main changes to the governance model of the organization, how it will support the development of the GRESB Standards going forward, and offer a chance to discuss and collect feedback.

As you may recall, results of our 2021 GRESB Stakeholder Survey indicated variability in respondents’ understanding of how our data was used, particularly by institutional investors. GRESB case studies In an effort to shed light on this question, we have started a series of case studies that explore the many ways our community uses GRESB, starting with a small selection of our more than 170 investor members. The first several case studies linked below delve into how investors use GRESB in their investment processes and decision-making – from evaluating companies and engaging with fund managers to preparing for risks and emerging regulations. We hope that the resulting insights can help current and prospective members gain a greater understanding of the broad value found in ESG data and the role that the GRESB assessments can play in supporting organizational goals.

An SFDR Assessment for infrastructure funds will be available later in the year. Amsterdam, July 25, 2022: GRESB has launched an SFDR Reporting Solution for real estate, designed to help managers with Article 8 or Article 9 funds meet the most arduous part of the new regulation – reporting on product- and entity-level ESG practices. SFDR Reporting Solution The SFDR Reporting Solution provides an interactive report that includes all the information needed for a fund manager to finalize a Principal Adverse Impact Statement, a core requirement under SFDR. The report – which will be made available following the completion of the new SFDR Assessment for real estate – highlights a fund’s: Overall product characteristics and environmental impacts, as defined by SFDR Energy consumption, estimated GHG emissions, water usage and waste generation Aggregated performance on each of the relevant Principal Adverse Impact Indicators In cases where a fund manager doesn’t have a full picture of a building’s energy consumption – which is common with triple net leases – participants can choose to use the GRESB Estimation Model (GEM), which provides a highly accurate stand-in for the missing data by comparing the floor area, location and property subtype of the building against the entire GRESB database. “Now, fund managers can tackle SFDR’s central data challenge and future-proof their year-over-year reporting from the start with better data,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “We created this solution to provide fund managers with the flexibility and the data they need to stay compliant at a very competitive price and time investment. And a significant portion of the SFDR reporting burden has been eliminated for entities that have already reported asset-level data through the 2022 GRESB Real Estate Assessment.” Product availability The SFDR Assessment for real estate is accessible now in the GRESB Portal.

While many GRESB Members and Partners are finalizing their submissions, we are looking forward to July, when we expect to announce the launch of the GRESB SFDR Assessment for real estate. SFDR is a new transparency requirement for financial market participants doing business in the European Union.

The GRESB SFDR Reporting Solution will help you comply with the regulation by helping you collect more accurate PAI statements from the start, future-proofing your reporting. GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model What happens if data is missing for environmental PAIs, like GHG emissions of a building? In these cases, GRESB leverages its global database of more than 100,000 individual assets to provide an estimation based on a highly representative median intensity that avoids the worst effects of outliers. Learn more about GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model and how it makes SFDR reporting more accurate. (Want to be informed when the SFDR assessment is launched? Sign up here.)

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-launches-new-net-zero-and-tcfd-products-for-asset-managers/,GRESB launches new transition risk and TCFD products for asset managers,"Climate-related reporting products leverage existing GRESB Assessment data to provide powerful insights for real estate and infrastructure asset managers without additional reporting burdens Amsterdam, May 16, 2022: GRESB – the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments – has launched two new products to help asset managers get ahead of emerging sustainability-related business challenges, with one focused on net zero alignment and the other TCFD requirements. Transition Risk Report The first new product is the GRESB Transition Risk Report, which shows real estate portfolio managers which of their assets are most exposed to climate-related transition risk and how this may affect their portfolio over time, at both a country and global level. The report draws on asset data already provided through the annual GRESB Real Estate Assessment, benchmarking the data against CRREM’s science-based decarbonization pathways. Where needed, the report also makes use of GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model to provide portfolio managers with highly accurate estimations of GHG emissions. The resulting insights allow asset managers to: Analyze their portfolio’s overall transition risk exposure See where transition risk is concentrated within a given portfolio Prioritize decarbonization efforts at the asset level “Today, 25 percent of global real estate is already facing transition risk,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “As this number rises each year and portfolios are placed under increasing pressure to decarbonize, it’s vital that asset managers have the tools and insights necessary to navigate these risks and to take appropriate action. Because these reports are generated from data already provided through the assessment, there is no need for additional data collection efforts.” In the real estate sector, the most prominent transition risks relate to policy and regulatory changes stemming from government efforts to meet regional goals established by the Paris Agreement. Assets with excessive transition risk have high GHG emissions compared to local net zero pathways, which may result in the assets being unable to meet future regulatory requirements. To learn more about the Transition Risk Report or to schedule a demo, please visit: gresb.com/transition TCFD Alignment Report The other new product is the GRESB TCFD Alignment Report, which helps participants of any of the three GRESB Assessments – Real Estate, Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure Asset – to tackle reporting challenges related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD’s final recommendations that were introduced in 2017 as voluntary measures are quickly becoming integrated into regulatory frameworks across the globe. And according to the most recent GRESB data, less than 20 percent of all organizations that participate in GRESB assessments have all of the necessary processes, strategies and data collections systems in place to satisfy TCFD. Pulling together relevant information already provided to GRESB through the yearly assessments, the TCFD Alignment Report shows an entity how aligned it is to TCFD requirements and provides a clear foundation to develop necessary TCFD processes and reporting efforts. With the report, GRESB Members can: Identify TCFD gaps and where improvements can be made Compare themselves against peers and see what recommendations are being prioritized Learn how they can get fully aligned with TCFD expectations Engage with investors, highlighting climate-related risk management processes “The majority of organizations are not yet ready for TCFD and still need to translate strategies into risk management processes,” added Roussotte. “Just by participating in GRESB Assessments, organizations have already taken the first steps towards TCFD disclosures. Without any additional reporting needing to be done, GRESB Members can see where they stand in relation to TCFD, helping them fulfill regulatory requirements at a very competitive price.” Learn more about the TCFD Alignment Report or schedule a demo at: gresb.com/TCFD Product availability Both products are available to GRESB Members now. You can purchase the Transition Risk Report here, and the TCFD Alignment Report here."

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-foundation-update-april-2022/,GRESB Foundation update – April 2022,"The GRESB Foundation was established late last year and has been in operation throughout 2022, working on several key priorities. Following the appointment of the inaugural Foundation Board and the establishment of the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, recruitment for the Expert Resource Groups has now been completed. Thanks to everyone who applied for this round of recruitment. The Foundation received an incredible selection of high-quality applications for both groups. Since the beginning of the year, the Foundation Board has met five times and each of the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees has met three times. This is a significant commitment from all groups, and we thank the representatives who have provided their valuable time and input in getting us to where we are today. The Foundation continues to work on the Standards Roadmap, building on the vision that was developed at the end of the year and informing the overall strategy, which is being guided by an independent strategy facilitator. Key issues identified for the GRESB Standards include: How to better address progress against core issues like Net Zero targets; Physical Climate Risk; Diversity, Equity & Inclusion; Embodied Carbon; Health & well-being; Human Rights; Biodiversity; and CybersecurityMoving from focusing more on the scoring effort to scoring outcomesBetter reflecting the different materiality of ESG issues across sectors and regions The Foundation Board has endorsed the inclusion of the CRREM Pathways into the 2022 Real Estate Benchmark Reports (for reporting only, not scored). On stakeholder engagement, the Foundation trialed a new engagement platform intended to streamline and enhance our process, and we have recruited a new Stakeholder Engagement Manager to support the Foundation, who will start on 1 May. In addition to coordinating key roles and responsibilities between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV, this role will facilitate the: Timely and effective engagement on the GRESB Standards with GRESB BVProvision of market research and gap analysis with other reporting frameworks, provided for by GRESB BVThe flow of information and feedback between the Foundation, GRESB BV, and industry stakeholdersProvision of appropriate support to the Foundation to ensure that it can effectively carry out its activities The Foundation Board and both Standards Committees will continue to meet on a regular basis to work on key priorities for the year, including: Publish an update on the GRESB roadmap in JuneEstablish Working Groups to tackle key topics that will feed into the roadmap process (we will reach out to the Expert Resource Groups in the coming weeks)Undertake detailed research to inform the roadmap process over the next few months, which means the Standards Committees will not meet until this has been concludedDraft the GRESB Standards RoadmapDraft the 2023 GRESB StandardsConsult with stakeholders on the draftsFinalize the GRESB Standards Roadmap by year-endFinalize the 2023 GRESB Standards by year-endConduct annual reviewsHold an annual meeting between the Foundation and the GRESB BV Supervisory Board The GRESB Roadmap Strategy was intended to be published in April; however, while working on the roadmap with the GRESB Foundation it has become clear that more detailed research is needed. We will publish an update on this work in June and then the draft standards and roadmap later in the year. The GRESB Foundation is the primary platform for GRESB to engage with the industry. To date, the focus of this engagement has been via the Foundation Board and Standards Committees, with Working Groups soon to be established. We recognize that there is a need for broader engagement with the industry and stakeholders beyond these formal groups, and we are exploring the best mechanisms for this, including: An online stakeholder engagement platform (mentioned above)Regular regional or sectoral forums for Members and PartnersUpdates included in the GRESB Newsletters We welcome input on any ideas for this broader engagement via our contact form."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/investors-unite-to-push-for-deeper-esg-reporting-across-asia-pacific/,Investors unite to push for deeper ESG reporting across Asia-Pacific,"Collaborative engagement will reach 50 companies in 12 regional markets SYDNEY, April 6, 2022 – A group of 16 investors representing US $19 trillion have launched a round of coordinated engagements to strengthen dialogue on ESG performance and GRESB participation with real estate companies across 12 key markets in the APAC region. The work is undertaken in close collaboration with GRESB, a global ESG benchmark for real estate portfolios. This year’s initiative – focused on markets such as Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan – is supported by established investors including B&I Capital, Bouwinvest, CenterSquare, Heitman, JP Morgan Asset Management, and Schroders. Real estate companies in Asia-Pacific tend to score highly in the GRESB Benchmark, often leading the world in aggregate, but tend to submit data later in their ESG journey than companies in other regions, which has led to underrepresentation in total numbers. In addition to providing ESG data directly to investors, real estate companies that participate in GRESB often indirectly benefit through ESG indices such as the iEdge-UOB APAC Green Reit Index launched in October 2021, which uses GRESB Assessment performance data. This year, 50 companies will be engaged and invited to participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. This is an expansion from last year, in which 13 investors collaborated with GRESB to reach out to more than 30 companies in nine Asian markets. Tomas Hlavaty, Sustainability & Data Analyst – B&I Capital “We are convinced any company developing and reporting its ESG positively contributes to the evolution of market best practice, transparency, data collection, and impact which is beneficial to all stakeholders and common goals.” Tim Kesseler, Portfolio Analyst, Listed – Bouwinvest “We develop full ESG models in addition to our financial models for our integrated listed and non-listed investments. At Bouwinvest we view companies with strong ESG standards favorably. It is very helpful where companies participate in GRESB as this means that the information will go automatically into our models.” Joachim Kehr, Portfolio & Regional Manager, Asia-Pacific – CenterSquare “At CenterSquare our investment experience over the past decades has taught us that ESG integration is a key driver of performance and participation in GRESB allows us and company participants to measure said integration in a transparent and comparable way. Increased engagement particularly through GRESB is a cornerstone of continually improving performance and impacting positive change.” John White, Senior Managing Director, Asia-Pacific – Heitman “We see multiple risks and opportunities from ESG. Where companies are effectively managing their stakeholders this is a signal of better quality management.” JP Morgan Asset Management “Real estate companies that do not keep pace with strong ESG credentials are likely to face accelerated obsolescence in a world where investors increasingly avoid properties that are left behind from an environmental perspective. We look forward to exercising our stewardship responsibilities in partnership with GRESB to support APAC real estate companies’ outperformance both financially and environmentally.” Justin Blaess, Principal & Portfolio Manager – Quay Global Investors “Companies that take a proactive approach to ESG issues and disclosure are more likely to be tomorrow’s winners.” Tom Walker, Co-Head of Global Listed Real Assets – Schroders “While investors always like to see listed developers and REITs with high GRESB scores, we want to see broad industry participation; it is important that the real estate sector unifies behind an agreed set of principles. GRESB participation allows us to see how a fund is changing and improving over time. To us, it is key that companies start the process and understand the crucial role they can play.” Investors supporting the engagement include: Aegon Asset Management AEW B&I Capital BMO Global Asset Management Bouwinvest CenterSquare Cohen & Steers Heitman JP Morgan Asset Management Legal & General Investment Management MFS Investment Management Quay Global Investors Resolution Capital Schroders About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data to financial markets.

Of particular note, we: Refactored the real estate asset-level aggregation from scratch Added new filters on the Infrastructure Assessment page for easier navigation between funds and assets Introduced new outlier checks on the GAV, Revenue and NAV values that participants can provide Made it possible for listed companies to see which Investor Members have access to listed data on the Access page While all updates will make the Portal more user friendly, the time spent refactoring the asset-level aggregation is expected to significantly improve the overall performance and speed of the GRESB Portal, leading to better performance for all users. Please note that we still encourage everyone to submit their assessments as early as possible to avoid heavy traffic on the site as the reporting deadline approaches. If you have any assessment-related questions at any stage of the process, please contact us here and we will get back to you within two working days. One Portal update you will not see when you first log in relates to our new products: the Transition Risk Report, the TCFD Report and the SFDR Assessments. We are currently finalizing updates to the Portal interface for these products, which will be introduced to the Portal in the coming months. We are happy to announce that the Transition Risk Report is now available to members prior to the product’s official launch later this quarter. If you are interested in gaining early access to the report, please contact Kevin Kirby or Steven Pringle. You can find more information about the Transition Risk Report on our website and download a sample report here. Please note that the report is only available to Real Estate participants.

The Foundation Board and the Foundation Secretariat are extremely grateful to all the members of the Foundation, all of whom share a commitment to positive market transformation powered by transparency and competitive differentiation. Each of them has volunteered countless hours of their time to ensure the GRESB Standards remain independent, mission driven, investor led, and reflective of the industries and members. GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap & 2024 Standards Changes The GRESB Foundation just released its forward-looking 2024 Roadmap, which reflects upon future priorities for the Standards for the near- and longer-term future. The document also highlights the Foundation’s hierarchy of advisory groups that help evolve the Standards, alongside critical support from the industry. GRESB also just released its much-anticipated 2024 Standards changes. Every year, as part of the annual standards development process, the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees review stakeholder feedback and potential improvements to the GRESB Standards. They then make recommendations of their endorsed changes to the Foundation Board, which ultimately determines the advancements to the Standards. GRESB also recently announced a new Infrastructure Development Asset Assessment, which will launch in April 2024. This new assessment is designed to cater to pre-operational assets in the development and construction phase. For a detailed description of the process, the objectives, and the changes, please visit our 2024 GRESB Standards – Roadmap, changes and events page. Please also see more information about how GRESB aligns with other ESG reporting frameworks.

AMSTERDAM, November 22, 2021 – GRESB is pleased to announce that it has established the independent, non-profit GRESB Foundation (a Dutch stichting) to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based. This follows the management buy-out of GRESB from GBCI in November 2020 in partnership with global alternative investment firm, Summit Partners. Our shared industry vision is a real asset investment industry that plays a critical role in creating a sustainable world – one where society can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. The transition to sustainable real assets is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, standardized global benchmarks and collective action from all our stakeholders as we work towards a more sustainable future. GRESB’s new governance structure is shown in the diagram below: The GRESB Foundation has established a new governance structure, consisting of Standards Committees, Expert Resource Groups and Working Groups. The GRESB Foundation Board will start a formal nomination and selection process from GRESB members to fill vacant roles on its Board and positions on the committees and resource groups. Reflecting the “investor-led” nature of GRESB, at least two-thirds of these positions will be held by representatives of investor members and up to one-third by participant members, industry partners (i.e. industry associations) and partners. “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by-industry, for-industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization. I look forward to serving on the Foundation Board alongside my former GRESB non-executive director colleagues – Deborah Ng, Head of Responsible Investing and Director, Total Fund Management, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), and Mathieu Elshout, Head of Sustainability & Impact Investing, PATRIZIA, as well as the chairs of the current GRESB Advisory Boards – Alison Schneider, Vice President, Responsible Investment, Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), and Kathleen Jowett, Fund Manager, LaSalle Global Partner Solutions.” GRESB BV will continue to be responsible for administering the GRESB Assessments, providing the assessment, validation, scoring and benchmarking as well as promoting widespread adoption of the GRESB Standards and supporting its members. GRESB BV is a benefit corporation, which will seek formal B-Corp certification in order to protect the accountability for its mission over the long term. “Since the change of ownership last year, we have collaborated with trusted and recognized industry leaders on the details of the GRESB Foundation and how it will work with GRESB BV to continue the important work of GRESB over the last 11 years and set a solid foundation for the future,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB BV. “With the need for reliable ESG data only becoming more important, this new structure formalizes our engagement with investors, managers and other stakeholders, ensuring that all of our activities are in tune with the needs of our industry.“ Christian Strain, Chairman of GRESB BV Supervisory Board, said, “Representing the new shareholders in GRESB, we are very pleased that the non-profit part of the organisation has now been formally established. We look forward to working in partnership with the GRESB Foundation towards our shared vision of Sustainable Real Assets”.

The GRESB Foundation is currently seeking dedicated candidates to sit on its inaugural Foundation Board, Standards Committees and Expert Resource Groups. GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization, and the purpose of the newly established Foundation Board is to own and govern the standards on which the GRESB Assessments are based. The foundation’s goal is to ensure that the GRESB Standards and Assessments remain independent and reflective of the industries and members they were created to serve.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-member-and-partner-survey-report-2021/,GRESB Member and Partner Survey Report – 2021,"Earlier in 2021, we launched an 18-month stakeholder engagement process to seek input and collaboration from all Members and Partners as we create a strategic roadmap for the GRESB Standards and Assessments for both Real Estate and Infrastructure. The first phase of this process involves defining a shared vision for the future, and in September 2021 we circulated a survey seeking the industry’s help to shape what this should be. You can find the aggregate survey responses here: GRESB Real Estate Assessment GRESB Infrastructure Assessments As a next step, we will hold “vision sessions” with the governance groups (Real Estate and Infrastructure Advisory Boards and Benchmark Committees) to confirm the joint vision for the GRESB Standards and to identify key priorities for their development. Following this, the GRESB Foundation Board will share a formal vision document that will drive our shared work on the roadmap. For further updates, please see the Strategic Roadmap page."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/greener-yields-from-reits/,Greener Yields from REITs,"Key Highlights REITs are favoured by investors as they offer attributes from both fixed income and equities, while providing exposure to real assets. In line with the rise of interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors the concept of “double materiality” is making its way into the world of REITs, where the effects of environmental and social issues on the REIT’s activities and bottom line, as well as the effect of the REIT’s activities on the environment and society are considered. In a 2021 JLL survey of over 550 occupiers and real estate investors in the Asia Pacific, over 70% of corporate occupiers are willing to pay a rental premium to lease certified green buildings as part of efforts to meet their decarbonisation goals. Between 2020 to 2030, Cushman and Wakefield projects demand for an additional 1.35 billion square feet of office space across the Asia Pacific region. The iEdge-UOB APAC Yield Focus Green REIT index uses GRESB Assessment data to deliver improved risk-adjusted performance by rewarding REITs with a higher weight based on the environmental performance of the REITs. GRESB is a mission driven and investor led organization providing standardized and validated ESG data to the capital markets through an annual self-reported assessment that is scored by GRESB. The material environmental performance aspects of the REITs are measured using four indicators; Energy Consumption, Water Consumption, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Green Building Certifications The index provides comparable financial performance to a broader APAC REITs index while providing improved environmental performance.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/australia-continues-to-lead-the-way-in-gresb-results/,Australia continues to lead the way in GRESB results,"Tuesday, 19 October 2021 Key insights Australia has ranked number one in GRESB results for the 11th consecutive year Oceania maintains the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark The 2021 benchmark saw GRESB’s largest ever growth; the group of listed entities grew by 20%, the non-listed group grew by 25% GRESB now covers US$5.7 trillion of assets under management, up from US$4.8 trillion in 2020, and nearly 117,000 individual assets Notable performance improvements were recorded in GHG emission, water and waste reductions with the most improvement seen in materials, highlighting the increased focus on material selection and embodied carbon Australian property companies have topped the results of the 2021 GRESB Real Estate Assessment ranking, proving once again that Australia’s real estate sector leads the world in sustainability. GRESB is the global benchmark for environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of real assets and Green Building Council of Australia’s (GBCA) CEO Davina Rooney has applauded Australian companies for outperforming other regions for the eleventh consecutive year. “In what has been a challenging year globally, our region keeps lifting the bar of ESG and sustainability within the property sector by meeting GRESB’s targets then innovating to improve results year on year. “As we all have our eyes set on Glasgow as COP26 approaches, Australia’s property sector has strengthened its commitment to climate change mitigation, emission reduction and sustainability performance, and this commitment is second to none,” Ms Rooney said. The GRESB Real Estate Assessment generates two benchmarks. The GRESB Standing Investments Benchmark considers management and performance factors and is is aimed at portfolios with operating buildings, while the GRESB Development Benchmark considers management and development factors and is for portfolios with new construction and major renovation projects. Globally, Oceania maintains the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Investment Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark. Participation in the GRESB Assessment experienced its largest ever growth with the group of listed entities growing by 20% while the non-listed group grew by 25%, a spike likely driven by investor interest in ESG data and industry’s focus on emerging regulations. Property Council of Australia’s Chief Executive, Ken Morrison, says GRESB’s ESG data is highly valued by investors, and defines the standards of sustainability performance and reporting. “GRESB continues to set the international goalposts for ESG performance and Australia continues to score highly, showing the rest of the world how a sustainable, net zero and healthy future is possible. “Our industry’s leadership is testament to what can be achieved when targets are in place and our sector leaders should be recognised and praised for their willingness to innovate to meet these goals,” Mr Morrison said. GRESB’s Head of Asia Pacific, Ruben Langbroek, says the impacts of climate change and the international pandemic have accelerated responsible investments within the property industry, with institutional investors increasingly allocating their capital to portfolios that generate positive environmental, social and economic outcomes. “We are realising that the environmental and social challenges we face cannot be solved with a business-as-usual approach. Our industry needs to respond by building back better, reaching net zero earlier and moreover, becoming climate positive. “The 2021 GRESB results for Oceania show that transformative change is possible, and transparency on ESG performance supports this transition,” Mr Langbroek said. — GRESB’s global leaders for Australia 2021 GRESB Real Estate Standing Investments Sector Leaders Overall Global Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector)* Office – Shared between Lendlease International Towers Sydney Trust, Lendlease; and Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Non-listed – Australian Prime Property Fund Retail, Lendlease *Overall Global Sector Leaders are also recognised as being the “Global Sector Leaders” by GRESB for achieving the highest score for the combination of nature of ownership and sector Overall Regional Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector and region) Diversified – Office/Retail – Dexus Wholesale Property Fund, Dexus Industrial – Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited, Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited Office – Shared between Lendlease International Towers Sydney Trust, Lendlease; and Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Australian Prime Property Fund Retail, Lendlease Diversified – Office/Industrial – Shared between Cromwell Property Trust 12, Cromwell Property Group; and Growthpoint Properties Australia, GrowthPoint 2021 GRESB Real Estate Development Sector Leaders Overall Global Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector)* Diversified – ISPT Core Fund, ISPT Pty Ltd Diversified – Office/Industrial – Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited, Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited Office – Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Shared between Scentre Group, Scentre Group; and Unisuper, managed by AMP Capital Investors Limited *Overall Global Sector Leaders are also recognised as being the “Global Sector Leaders” by GRESB for achieving the highest score for the combination of nature of ownership and sector Overall Regional Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector and region) Industrial – Shared between Core Logistics Partnership (CLP), Charter Hall; and Goodman Australia Partnership (GAP), Goodman Group Office – Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Residential – Lendlease Retirement Living Trust, Lendlease Retail – Shared between Scentre Group, Scentre Group; and Unisuper, managed by AMP Capital Investors Limited About Green Building Council of Australia Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) is the nation’s authority on sustainable buildings and communities.

Developed by SGX as part of the SGX iEdge product suite, in collaboration with UOBAM, the index covers 50 higher-yielding REITs that display relatively better environmental performance based on GRESB’s real estate assessment, while also meeting liquidity requirements. GRESB is the global leader for ESG research of real assets, covering over 1,500 property companies, REITS, funds and developers with US$5.7 trillion in assets under management. For this index, the underlying REITs are weighted by their relative environmental performance using GRESB data for indicators such as energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and green building certifications, in addition to their ESG performance. Ng Kin Yee, Managing Director and Head of Data, Connectivity and Indices, SGX, said, “Sustainable investing is now a key consideration in portfolio allocation, and this is driving demand and innovation in partnership with iEdge’s indexing services. Since the establishment of iEdge, we have been customising and developing proprietary indices for our global clients, in a well-governed manner through purpose-driven design, strong research and data partnerships.” “This new index in partnership with UOBAM and GRESB is uniquely underpinned by Singapore’s position as the most international REIT hub globally, and we look forward to this index becoming investible for market participants who are increasingly environmentally focused,” he added. Thio Boon Kiat, Chief Executive Officer, UOBAM, said, “The APAC Green REIT Index seeks to respond to market demand for ESG-focused investment products and aligns with UOB Asset Management’s aim of driving sustainability by putting environment, social and governance (ESG) impact at the heart of our business. While investors are keen to put their money in quality companies that are sustainable and score highly on ESG metrics, data on the companies’ ESG performance can be difficult to discern. UOBAM brings more than three decades of investment expertise in Asia to incorporate ESG factors and considerations into REITS investments and this rigorously constructed index will help investors to invest for both profit and purpose.” Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB, said, “Transitioning to a sustainable world is a fundamental challenge that we must face together. GRESB is pleased to partner with SGX and UOBAM to support the growth in sustainable real estate across the Asia-Pacific region and provide global investors with the critical data needed to align their investment allocations with ESG integration practices.”"
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2021-gresb-results-show-record-growth-in-infrastructure-and-real-estate-participation/,2021 GRESB Results show record growth in infrastructure and real estate participation,"AMSTERDAM, October 15, 2021: GRESB – the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for capital markets – has released the results of its 2021 Assessments. Full results can be found for the 2021 Real Estate Assessment Results (and Real Estate Sector Leaders) and the 2021 Infrastructure Assessment Results (and Infrastructure Sector Leaders). Key real estate insights The 2021 benchmark saw the largest ever growth in total numbers, with 1,520 entities now participating worldwide, with significant growth focused in Europe Average GRESB scores increased to 73 for the Standing Investments Benchmark and 79 in the Development Benchmark, following last year’s assessment restructure Oceania continues to lead the way, with the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark Significant performance improvements were noted in GHG emission, water and waste reductions, a result of both Covid-19 and continued investment in improving efficiencies Key infrastructure insights This year saw the largest ever increase in asset participation, with 558 assets now reporting, and the second largest increase in fund participation, now at 149 Funds completing both assessment components jumped 41% to 106, that is funds obtaining a GRESB Fund Score reflecting overall ESG performance at the portfolio level While few assets have net zero targets, recent commitments by managers representing 40% of reporting assets are expected to drive significant increases in the years ahead Asset participation growth was led by Renewable Power, with a 65% increase from 2020 Significant regional growth in asset participation was seen in the Americas (35%) and Asia (48%) Overall, the gross asset value reporting to GRESB has increased by more than 50% since 2019 “Across the globe, organizations are demonstrating a deep commitment to ESG integration while making important strides towards a more sustainable future for us all,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “ESG transparency and improving overall performance have never been more important, and it is inspiring to see such a high level of dedication across industries.” Real Estate Results Participation in the Real Estate Benchmark grew by 24% this year, to 1,520. This is the highest percentage increase the assessment has seen since 2012 and the highest ever increase in total numbers. The benchmark now covers $5.7 trillion of AuM (up from $4.8 trillion) and nearly 117,000 individual assets. Growth has been driven mainly by Europe, which saw massive growth for the second year in a row and now accounts for nearly half of the entire benchmark. High continued growth in Europe is likely driven by both investor interest in ESG data and the industry’s focus on and attention to emerging regulations. The group of listed entities grew by 20% while the non-listed group grew by 25%. The Real Estate Benchmark now covers 49 of PERE’s Top 100 Fund Managers and has 69% coverage of the main global listed real estate indices. While average GRESB scores in 2020 were affected by last year’s assessment restructure, this year saw renewed score improvements. The average Standing Investments Benchmark score is 73 and the average Development Benchmark score is 79. Oceania continues to lead the way with averages scores of 79 and 84, respectively. Participants improved on scores across nearly every aspect of the assessment. Score improvement was particularly high in Data Monitoring & Review (a 9% average increase), underlying increased global efforts to improve verification of performance data. On the development side, the most improvement was seen in Materials, highlighting more focus on material selection and embodied carbon tracking in developments and renovations. The global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is noticeably reflected in performance scores. This year’s benchmark shows unprecedented reductions in utility usage, with like-for-like reductions in energy consumption, GHG emissions and water usage nearly threefold from previous years. These reductions were most pronounced in Asia, which saw decreases in energy consumption (8%), GHG emissions (10%) and water consumption (11%). To complement the Real Estate Assessment this year, GRESB surveyed Members and Partners on how Covid-19 has affected portfolio performance. Results showed that these sizable reductions are not solely attributable to the pandemic – participants are also making significant improvements engaging tenants and implementing efficiency measures. “This year, participation in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment jumped an impressive 24% to 1,520 portfolios across the globe,” said Charles van Thiel, Director of Real Estate at GRESB. “The industry continues to make impressive strides, deepening its commitment to ESG transparency and focusing on improving sustainability performance.” Infrastructure Results Despite the continued challenges posed by Covid-19, total participation in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 26%, to 149 funds completing the Management Component. The number of infrastructure funds completing both the Management and Performance components of the Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 41% to 106. The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers $343 billion of AuM at the fund level and $738 billion of AuM at the asset level. The fund assessment covers over 30% of the IPE Real Assets Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers and over a third of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50, based on participation with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 31% to cover 558 assets. While most assets are based in Europe, significant relative growth in participation numbers came from the Americas (105 to 142) and Asia (21 to 31). The assessment now covers 33 of the 34 industry sectors and 2,096 facilities across 69 countries. The average percentage of individual assets within funds reporting to GRESB continues to grow, which is now up to 83%. This increase shows that infrastructure managers are moving closer to asset-level reporting. By sector, Renewable Power saw the highest growth in participation (65%), followed by Environmental Services (64%), Transport (44%) and Network Utilities (27%). When it comes to GRESB scores, both funds and assets saw significant increases this year, similar to the impressive increases seen in 2020. On average, overall GRESB scores and component scores increased from 5 to 15 points. At the fund level, thirteen entities scored the maximum 100 for the Management Component, while only two saw score decreases. For assets, the average GRESB score increase was 10 points, largely coming from the Performance Component. By asset type, Diversified and Network Utilities are the top performing assets, with average GRESB scores of 80 and 79, respectively. The asset types that improved the most since last year were Social Infrastructure, with a 22 point increase, and Diversified, with a 20 point increase. The 2021 Infrastructure Asset Assessment shows continued improvement in target setting across all performance indicators, suggesting future improvements in performance that will follow. Among infrastructure assets and funds, Diversity has shown little to no improvement. While the average fund has an employee gender ratio of 40:60 between women and men, only 28% of funds’ governance and management roles are filled by women. As net zero is a growing interest in the industry, GRESB analysed the target setting that fund managers have committed to for their underlying portfolios. We found that – while Scope 1 and 2 GHG targets are often set by managers for at least one asset in their fund (57%) – only 23% of funds participating in the assessment have an asset in their portfolio with a net zero target. Even fewer (9%) have set science-based targets. That said, fund managers representing just over 40% of all our reporting assets became signatories to the “Net Zero Asset Managers” commitment in December 2020. We expect that in the coming years the number of net zero targets will spike, as assessment reporting reflects these recent commitments. “The infrastructure industry continues to make significant progress in its approach to ESG, with GRESB participation growing year over year,” said Roussotte. “We are proud to see the industry deepen its commitment to ESG transparency and continue improving overall performance.” Media contact: Tyler Guthrie, Director of Communications, GRESB [email protected]"

As the risks of climate change become more pronounced, participants are making important strides in accelerating the transition to a more sustainable asset industry.” The 2021 GRESB benchmarks cover the ESG performance of real estate and infrastructure funds, companies and assets, providing investors with validated data and a window into complex sustainability issues. GRESB data is now used by 140 institutional investors – with more than $47 trillion in assets under management – to better understand and benchmark the performance of their portfolios. This transparent data helps bridge the knowledge gap between actual and predictive performance in order to manage business risks and opportunities while accelerating the growth of responsible investment. 2021 Real Estate coverage This year, 1,520 property companies, REITs, funds and developers participated in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment (up from 1,229 in 2020), generating a benchmark that covers $5.7 trillion of AuM (up from $4.8 trillion). The benchmark covers nearly 117,000 assets (up from 96,000 last year), all of which are reported at the asset level. The data combines high-level overall scores with in-depth information across hundreds of ESG data points, including performance indicators such as GHG emissions, waste and energy and water consumption. The dataset now covers 1,187 non-listed funds and 326 listed property companies and REITs (up from 958 and 271, respectively) as well as seven governmental entities. When combined with the GRESB Public Disclosure Dataset, this includes full coverage of all major listed real estate indices. While global real estate participation increased by 24% this year, there were notable regional increases: Italian market coverage grew the most, both in terms of absolute and relative increases, with more than 50 new entities participating (a 329% increase from last year) German market coverage increased by 68%, with more than 30 new entities participating The United States market has now reached 300 participating entities The Japanese and Australian markets have both reached over 100 participating entities 2021 Infrastructure coverage The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 26% to cover 149 funds (up from 118 last year), and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 31% to include 558 assets (up from 426). The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers $343 billion of AuM at the fund level and $738 billion of AuM at the asset level. Assets that now participate in the Assessment are located in 69 countries, up from 59 last year. The average percentage of individual assets within funds reporting to GRESB continues to grow, which is now up to 83% – 6% higher than last year. This increase shows that infrastructure managers are moving closer to asset-level reporting. For the Asset Assessment, the Transport and Renewable Power sectors saw significant growth of 44% and 65%, respectively. The benchmark now reflects 148 transport assets and 134 renewable power assets. Paving the way for industry transformation Transitioning to a sustainable world is a fundamental challenge that we must face together. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, standardized global benchmarks and collective action from all stakeholders.

Standing as a testament to the industry’s resilience, GRESB is excited to announce that the number of participants this year greatly exceeded our growth targets for FY2021. Our gratitude extends to all of the hard-working teams who progressed tirelessly to collect the data, work through the challenges and coordinate the reporting. Together, we strengthen the calibre of the GRESB Benchmark every year. We’ll soon release full details to illustrate how comprehensive and representative of the industry our ESG benchmarks are. Below are just a few key highlights: 2021 Real Estate Coverage: 1,520 (2020: 1,229) real estate property companies, REITs, and real estate developers participated in the Real Estate Assessment, a 24% increase compared to 2020. 2021 Infrastructure Fund Coverage: The Infrastructure Fund Assessment saw a growth in participation of 26% to cover 149 funds (2020: 118). 2021 Infrastructure Asset Coverage: The Infrastructure Asset Assessment saw a growth in participation of 31% to cover 558 assets (2020: 426). ​​​​2021 Overall Participation: Overall GRESB Assessment participation grew from 1773 submissions in 2020, to 2227 in 2021, a staggering 26% increase.

As always, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. Kind regards, GRESB The validation process conducted by SRI Quality System Registrar, our accredited third-party assessment body, is now underway. We estimate more than 47,200 human validation decisions will be taken this year to ensure the quality of the reported data in preparation for scoring and benchmarking. This manual validation process complements the automated checks on information completeness, accuracy and reporting rules integrated in the Portal. In parallel, the Real Estate Team is conducting a reporting boundaries review to ensure portfolios submit 100% of their underlying assets. From September 1st – when the preliminary benchmark reports will be available – to September 15th, Participants can make official requests for validation and scoring reviews. Assessments and scores can then be updated until September 26. The launch of 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessment results will be October 1st. A more detailed overview of the Assessment timeline can be found here. SFDR | The ESAs have published a Q&A which provides further clarifications as to what constitutes article 8 and 9 products. Some of these clarifications remain vague, for instance, what constitutes the promotion of Environmental and Social Characteristics for Article 8 and whether sustainable investments for Article 9 products, defined in article 2 (17) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, have any overlap with the EU taxonomy’s own definition of what qualifies as a sustainable investment. This comes after the European Commision announced a 6 month delay in the application of the RTS leaving a big question mark as to if the final RTS documentation, originally meant to be published in June, will actually see the light of day. As such, GRESB remains attentive to any future developments. If you would like to keep up to date on our proposed solution and relevant SFDR resources you can do so via our SFDR Reporting Solution page.

Preliminary GRESB participation numbers demonstrate a change in attitude from easily neglected ‘non-financial’ factors to active engagement in the long term sustainability practices of businesses. These sentiments are echoed in the industry’s momentum towards net zero initiatives and climate related disclosures; from nations, coalitions of financial institutions and real estate industry bodies we are seeing a monumental shift towards sustainability commitments. While commitment is a necessary first step, much focus has now been rightly shifted toward execution. Financial actors and real asset operators alike are in need of credible tools and standards that are able to put their assets and portfolios into the context of these high-level commitments. GRESB is proactively working on answering the industry’s call by working on a solutionthat will help its Members evaluate the climate transition risk of their real estate portfolios and assets; you can find out more here.

The wave of global interest in ESG, from regulators and market participants alike, is ushering us into a new era of ESG performance assessment and benchmarking. We’re working not only to further standardize ESG data for the capital markets, but also to provide new tools to the industry to assist in meeting new regulatory requirements, enhance the management of sustainability risks, and accelerate the growth of responsible investment. All of this contributes to GRESB fulfilling our mission as a benefit corporation. We are growing the GRESB team, adding more capacity to support our stakeholders, and further investing in our data science and technology capabilities to strengthen our platform and will allow us to develop more products and tools to support both our benchmark participants and our investor members. New in 2021 GRESB is working hard on three new products which will be released in 2021 and 2022. We’re introducing an EU Regulatory (SFDR) Reporting Solution to help GRESB participants to meet their regulatory disclosure obligations. For our Members needing support with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we’re also developing a reporting solution. Finally, we are working on better understanding the real estate industry’s needs in relation to transition risk analytics built from the bottom-up, leveraging on CRREM’s decarbonization pathways. GRESB Management Board: To support this new era for GRESB, we have strengthened the capabilities of our Management Board bringing in key new hires with a diverse range of experience and skills to complement the existing staff. Our new CEO, Sebastien Roussotte brings extensive experience at the top level of financial services and data firms including Thomson Reuters, Sophis, Finastra and Style Analytics. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Guido Wagenaar brings more than 20 years experience in sales, marketing and business development, and our new CFO, Roel de Weerd has an accounting background with experience in c-suite roles in the property sector. They join Roxana Isaiu who now heads up our ESG & Benchmarks pillar comprising our Real Estate and Infrastructure teams; and Rick Walters, who has moved into a new role as Chief of Standards and Innovation, our key liaison with the GRESB Foundation and responsible for new product development. These changes see the departure of GRESB co-founder and former CEO, Sander Paul van Tongeren, who leaves a very valuable legacy to the staff and the industry; ‘In my tenure at GRESB, it has been inspiring to witness the collective industry effort to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets. I am proud to have contributed to this movement, and I am optimistic that GRESB will continue paving the way for a more sustainable real asset industry’, said Sander Paul. Sebastien commented : ‘GRESB is uniquely placed to help asset owners and investors with the guidance they need to measure and report on their key ESG indicators. We look forward to building on the successes to date while strengthening our collaboration with existing members and partners to uncover new ESG insights that are essential to support sustainable investment decision making.’ We’re delighted to welcome Sebastien, Guido, and Roel to the team as we embark on a new era for GRESB."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-sfdr-data-in-review/,GRESB and SFDR – Data in review,"GRESB has conducted a market analysis of publicly available level 1 disclosures from GRESB Fund Managers with activities in Europe to determine whether these business practices mention product classifications. SFDR from afar Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), sets standards for classifying funds or products as “grey” Article 6, “light green” Article 8 or “dark green” Article 9, with each level of classification having different product documentation and marketing materials, with strict reporting requirements for “green” funds. You can find out more about SFDR developments here. GRESB’s analysis explores both the Real Estate and Infrastructure domain. Real Estate Real Estate Findings Based on our analysis of 100 Real Estate Fund Managers with activities in Europe, 11% mentioned having products falling under Article 8, with 4% under article 9, and 7% specifically mentioning being Article 6. This suggests a rather conservative and cautious approach into disclosing product categorization information most probably due to remaining unclarities over specific requirements for Article 8 and 9. Product level disclosures are expected to come into force as of January 2022 with pre-contractual and periodic reporting and disclosure requirements. Findings also showed that no information relating to SFDR could be found for 71% of the 100 Real Estate Fund managers, and in addition to that, 17% of the Fund Managers researched have some level 1 disclosures in place but no product categorization at this stage. Interestingly enough, 31% of the FMP’s with SFDR disclosures (29) , mention GRESB with some saying that GRESB is the data source they use to measure and/or monitor the characteristics promoted by their products. Infrastructure Infrastructure Findings Based on our analysis of 33 Infrastructure fund managers with activities in Europe, 21% mentioned having products falling under Article 8, with 12% under article 9, only 3% specifically mentioning being Article 6. Note that 33% have some level 1 disclosures in place but no product categorization at this stage. Findings also showed that no information relating to SFDR could be found for 30% of the 33 Infrastructure Fund managers. This suggests a rather conservative and cautious approach into disclosing product categorization information most probably due to remaining unclarities over specific requirements for Article 8 and 9. Product level disclosures are expected to come into force as of January 2022 with pre-contractual and periodic reporting and disclosure requirements. Interestingly enough, 30% of the 20 FMP’s that have SFDR related disclosures, mention GRESB as being the data source they use to measure and/or monitor the characteristics promoted by their products. GRESB is introducing an SFDR reporting solution to help GRESB participants to meet their regulatory disclosure obligations. At the forefront of ESG reporting, GRESB is well placed to bridge the identified gaps and provide a simple way for the industry to meet their regulatory obligations with minimum reporting burden.

The honorees for the sixth annual list were nominated by GreenBiz readers around the world and selected by the GreenBiz editorial team from among hundreds of submissions. “This year’s selection process felt especially challenging, given the wealth of nominations and applications we received, and that gives me optimism about the future of the sustainability profession,” said GreenBiz Group Editorial Director Heather Clancy. “What these twenty-somethings have accomplished already is impressive. Every generation of leader has much to learn from their fresh perspective on solving the interconnected challenges of the climate crisis and economic inequity.” Thanks to the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Net Impact for helping spread the word during the nomination process. Members of this year’s cohort work within companies — large, small and in-between — that are making strides in their corporate sustainability efforts, including Unilever, Google, Starbucks, REI, UPS and Amy’s Kitchen. Others are making their voices heard in the sustainability world from other perches, including government, social enterprises and advocacy groups including the Port of Long Beach, Climate Group and the Environmental Defense Fund. This year’s roster ranges from managers and executive directors to founders and CEOs — despite the differences in their industries and sectors, these young leaders are driving the change our world needs. The 30 individuals being honored come from 12 countries — from the United States to Rwanda to Lithuania. They work for multinational corporations, innovative startups, social enterprises, nonprofit organizations and government agencies. View the full “2021 GreenBiz 30 under 30” list here"
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-the-2021-reporting-season-is-underway/,GRESB Newsletter | The 2021 reporting season is underway,"The 2021 reporting season is underway The GRESB Reporting season is underway with real estate and infrastructure managers logging into the GRESB Portal to start their Assessment. We hope to work with you to maximize response rates and deliver timely ESG data and benchmarks to the industry. Future Outlook Earlier this month, we announced the development of a GRESB Roadmap, which will outline the future and ongoing strategic direction of the Assessments. While the new GRESB Foundation governance is being finalized, we will be relying on our GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure governance groups to develop this Roadmap. The first round of meetings with the Advisory Board and Benchmark Committees took place in the first two weeks of April and we are now collecting feedback on the first Assessment roadmap draft. Based on this feedback we will define a 2021 engagement schedule with the governance groups and the wider industry. We expect to release our Roadmap by the end of 2021. We look forward to supporting you through this reporting season. See our participant guidance with Assessment resources and information on our free online training for GRESB reporting. And if you have questions about completing any part of your Assessment, just contact us and we’ll get you moving again. GRESB also maintains a network of informed & experienced organizations who can assist you to complete your GRESB Assessment, manage your ESG data and advance your performance. To find out which partner can best assist you, see our Partner Directory. New 2021 GRESB Assessment Resources Real Estate Asset Portal Validation Rules Real Estate Aggregation Rules Handbook Infrastructure Scope 3 Guidance Supplement We have high levels of interest in our online training and Q&As. Check out the most recent recordings and new dates below. Response Check You can now request a Response Check in the GRESB Portal. Response Checks will be carried out by SRI and feature a careful review of your Assessment response followed by a 1-hour discussion call. We strongly encourage participants to place their request and schedule their call as early as possible because there are a fixed number of appointments and it is not uncommon for requests to surpass availability. It is not necessary to have the Assessment completed when placing the request. You can find out more about Response Checks here. Participant Agreement As a reminder, all 2021 participating managers are required to have signed the GRESB Participant Agreement, which includes our Participant T&Cs. This will also ensure that you receive an invoice to pay your 2021 fees. If you have not already received an invoice or are ready to start that process, please fill in the short form on this page. You can find the 2021 fee schedule here. Once again, the Portal has opened April 1 and, as in previous years, the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessment submissions are due by July 1, 2021. See the full 2021 Assessment timeline. If you have any questions about participating in the 2021 Assessments or any feedback for us, please contact the GRESB Helpdesk at any time. Best regards, GRESB By participating, you’ll have access to high-quality ESG data and powerful analytical tools to benchmark your ESG performance, identify areas for improvement and engage with your investors. You’ll also be better positioned to attract new investors who require more extensive ESG disclosure. Learn more about the benefits of participating. GRESB offers online training to help walk you through the reporting process. You can register for the free courses here. On May 11 and 12, we will hold another round of Q&A sessions for the Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. You can register for the session that best fits your time zone via the links below; May 11 | Infrastructure Asia-Pacific | Register May 11 | Infrastructure EMEA and Americas | Register May 12 | Real Estate Asia-Pacific | Register May 12 | Real Estate EMEA and Americas | Register For those who are based in Singapore, our GRESB Training Partner, Paia Consulting, is organizing an in-person training session on April 27. Find out more information here. GRESB is working with the Interim Foundation Council (the name for the initial Foundation Board prior to the Board being officially constituted) to finalize the documents to formally establish the GRESB Foundation. We have been meeting regularly to review the documents and expect that these can be finalized in the next few weeks. Due to the delay regarding the establishment of the Foundation, we are utilizing a modified approach to governance for 2021 utilizing a longer transition period to the Foundation. The existing governance groups (Real Estate and Infrastructure Advisory Boards and Benchmark Committees) will continue to meet as per usual until the Foundation is fully established. They will review the GRESB strategy and work on the 2022 Assessments. Once the Foundation is fully established and all Foundation Committees are in place, the existing governance groups will cease, and all work will transfer to the Foundation (including its Board and Committees). The process to establish the Foundation Committees needs to be designed by the Foundation Board. There may be differences compared to the existing governance groups in terms of structure, role and composition. The process for establishing these committees should be fair and transparent. We will advise all GRESB members once more information is available. Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Level I requirements have come into effect, and although a momentous milestone, there is still a long way to go until full implementation and disclosure. Despite its simple goal, the new SFDR requirements still leave room for diverse interpretation. As investors and fund managers embark on the journey of getting more familiar with the interpretation of the regulation as well as product disclosure depending on their categorization, peer discussions and engagement with their underlying investments are needed to make implementation and full disclosure at both entity and product level successful. GRESB is proactively monitoring the discussions and if you would like to keep up to date on our proposed solution and relevant SFDR resources you can do so here Pressure to disclose climate-related information is ramping up globally. New Zealand introduced a bill that will make climate-related disclosures mandatory for many listed issuers, large registered banks, investors, and asset managers. This was followed quickly by the re-introduction of a bill in the United States, which would require public companies to disclose specific climate-related information. GRESB seeks to help fund managers and investors understand their processes in relation to the TCFD’s recommendations, widely recognized as international best practice. Transition Risk Tool The latest CRREM publication, CRREM Report No. 5 on lessons learned and best-practice users, highlights the utility and versatility of the CRREM decarbonization pathways and sets precedence for best practice transition risk and climate goal alignment communication within the real estate sector. Highlighting the importance of industry standardization, GRESB seeks to make information on the Paris alignment, performance, and transition risks of Member assets even more accessible to them.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-crrem-and-pcaf-join-forces/,"GRESB, CRREM and PCAF Join Forces","GRESB, PCAF [Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials], and CRREM [Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor] are partnering up in 2021 to provide investors and banks with the guidance they need to measure and report on their financed emissions from real estate. Furthermore, this partnership is meant to help financial institutions formulate, set, and implement forward-looking targets in relation to their financed emissions. Amsterdam – April 21, 2021 – As the race to net zero gains momentum and regulatory bodies across the world scrutinize how the financial industry can influence the global push toward a more sustainable future, the ability to measure and understand financed emissions has never been more important. The trifecta of GRESB, PCAF, and CRREM is perfectly positioned to give guidance to investors and banks to do just that for their real estate portfolios. Over the course of 2021, the three bodies are partnering to harmonize their efforts and provide additional guidance to PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, released in its first edition in November 2020. The additional guidance will focus on the specific requirements and needs of the real estate sector. Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets at APG Asset Management and member of the GRESB Interim Foundation Council: “As the stewards of ESG data and standards for real assets, the GRESB Foundation welcomes the opportunity to work with PCAF and CRREM to provide the financial industry with the standardization and tools it needs to effectively calculate and communicate on its financed emissions within the real estate sector.” Giel Linthorst, Executive Director of PCAF: “This partnership with GRESB and CRREM is a clear example of the harmonization efforts that the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) has been working on. Alignment and harmonization with other initiatives is crucial to enable the financial sector to effectively measure, report, set targets and take actions towards net zero.” Prof. Dr. Sven Bienert, Founder and Managing Director of IIÖ: “Whereas in the past investors/owners were seen as the driving force to track, analyse and reduce energy consumption within the real estate industry, we recognize now another force supporting decarbonization efforts. Banks and other financial institutions providing debt to the market are increasingly demanding clarity regarding financed emissions – impact on loan pricing and lending can be expected soon.” The collaboration seeks to release its output this fall. The need for such guidance highlights the increasing importance of having a common framework across both investors and banks to measure and steer towards net-zero goals. About GRESB Mission-driven and investor-led, GRESB is the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets. It works in collaboration with the industry to provide standardized and validated ESG data to the capital markets. The GRESB 2020 Real Estate benchmark covered more than 1,200 property companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), funds, and developers. Its coverage for infrastructure includes 540 infrastructure funds and assets. Combined, GRESB represents over USD 4.5 trillion in real asset value. More than 100 institutional investors constituting over USD 22 trillion in AUM use GRESB data to monitor their investments, engage with their managers, and make decisions that lead to a more sustainable real asset industry. Following GRESB’s change in ownership, an independent, non-profit foundation – the GRESB Foundation – will be incorporated to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the Assessments are based. Contact: gresb.com/contact About PCAF PCAF is a global, industry-led initiative of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with loans and investments, known as financed emissions. Currently, over 100 financial institutions have committed to the initiative. In November 2020, PCAF published the first-ever Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Financial Industry, which covers the financed emissions of loans and investments in commercial real estate, mortgages, and various other asset classes. PCAF collaborates with several organizations, institutions, and coalitions, including CDP, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA). Contact: [email protected] About CRREM The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) project, originally funded by the EU 2020 Horizon programme, has derived decarbonization pathways that translate the ambitions of the Paris Agreement (to limit global warming to 2°C with ambition to 1.5°C by the end of the century) into regionally- and property-type-specific trajectories against which real estate assets and portfolios can benchmark themselves. These pathways, while primarily alignment tools, may also be used as proxies for “transition risk” (in this case, the risk of assets being stranded due to regulatory incompliance or market obsolescence) insofar as the covered nations follow similar decarbonization strategies. CRREM’s scope now covers the majority of global real estate markets, and residential as well as commercial real estate. These pathways are finalized and publicly available.

For more information on the SFDR Solution, check out our SFDR information page. TCFD A recent paper from Zurich on the quality and content of the growing number of climate-related disclosures from TCFD-supporting firms comes to “the sobering conclusion that the firms’ TCFD support is mostly cheap talk and that firms cherry-pick to report primarily non-material climate risk information.” This corroborates the growing importance of standardized TCFD reporting. With the TCFD-aligned integration of the Resilience Module complete, GRESB is exploring the case for structured and transparent TCFD reports that leverage the GRESB process of standardizing, validating, and benchmarking data to provide our Members with clear, concise, and actionable insights on how entities are handling climate-related issues. Transition Risk Tool As commitments around Net Zero continue to pick up steam in the financial industry, an understanding of Paris-alignment and transition risk has never been more important. GRESB is working on a solution to help its Members evaluate their portfolios and assets against these issues, including benchmarking against the science-based CRREM global decarbonisation pathways, with GHG metrics and analytics built from the bottom-up.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/the-evolution-of-real-asset-resilience/,The Evolution of Real Asset Resilience,"Resilience Insights Series: Part 1 The GRESB Resilience Module was launched in 2018 in an effort to evaluate the data that would provide investors and fund managers alike with an understanding of how resilience is considered within real asset investment processes. Over the 3-year lifecycle of the Module — from designing the indicators, engaging with stakeholders, discussing with our governance groups, and analyzing and contextualizing Module results — GRESB has learned a lot about resilience in general. Furthermore, we’ve developed an understanding of how our Participants think about resilience and how to collect the most relevant data in a way that can be expressed clearly to our Members. In its inaugural year, the Resilience Module was completed by 121 Real Estate entities and 37 Infrastructure Asset entities. In its final year of 2020, participation in the Module had grown to 412 Real Estate entities, 98 Infrastructure Asset entities, and 28 Infrastructure Fund entities, representing roughly 34%, 23%, and 24% of total GRESB participation for the GRESB Assessments, respectively. This rapid uptake mirrors the growth in investor awareness and interest in real asset resilience and climate-related issues. It also suggests that much of the market is still in the early stages of its collective approach to these, perhaps daunting, issues. The Resilience Module has been discontinued in 2021, as its most useful and insightful elements have been incorporated into the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. We are excited to integrate the most evolved resilience indicators into our Assessments in pursuit of our mission to provide standardized, validated, and benchmarked data to the capital markets, and contributing to our collective progress toward a more sustainable real asset sector and, by extension, a more sustainable world. This Resilience Insights series is meant to serve three main purposes. Firstly, to put our learnings over the past three years into context and provide an orientation of how they guided the integration of climate-related resilience into the main Assessments. Secondly, to provide expert commentary on subjects core to the understanding of resilience, particularly as it relates to real assets. And thirdly, to disseminate high-level output/insights from the final iteration of the Resilience Module. The Resilience Insights series will unfold as follows: Article 1 provides a brief background on the GRESB Resilience Module, an introduction to the series, and three high-level lessons learned from the Resilience Module lifecycle Article 2 will explore the concept of climate risk and how it relates to climate resilience Article 3 will explore best practices and what effective organizational leadership looks like in terms of resilience Article 4 will explore the concept of resilient business strategy and its operationalization into effective risk management Article 5 will explore the concept of social risk, its nascent status within institutional understanding, and provide context to users who may have struggled with the category in hopes of advancing the ESG conversation Resilience as a general concept has been around for quite some time. However, the financial industry’s interest in resilience, and how it might be used as an indicator of market outperformance, is more recent. And with its entrance into this new “market,” the term resilience is still going through the growing pains experienced by any new buzzword: overuse, mis-use, oversimplification, over-correction, etc. Transparency is key in sorting through market confusion. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. Resilience as a state — as understood in the question “is your asset/portfolio resilient?” — raises the question: resilient to what? Resilient to climate change? Resilient to hurricanes? Wildfires? Pandemics? Cyber-attacks? This is quickly followed by the question: resilient to what degree? Resilience to storm surges of 1 meter? What about 2 meters? How about tsunamis? We see that resilience as a state is not an easy claim to make without a significant amount of scoping. Resilience as a process is no less of a challenge to wrangle. While it might evade the absolutism of resilience as a state by only dealing with its more relative nature, it nevertheless comes with its own set of perhaps even more difficult questions. Does a process promote or degrade the qualities generally associated with resilience? How quickly does an organization respond to change? How quickly and completely might it recover when it experiences a situation in which it takes damage or loses value, as it almost inevitably will? And critically, how can indicators of process be designed in ways that strongly correlate with an organization’s ability to be resilient to the wide range of potential climate impacts and opportunities as they actually occur? GRESB traditionally hints at processes rather than end states. We provide a standardized benchmark for ESG considerations to the extent the information is captured about the existence of an ESG policy or the scope of a process. As such, we take a similar approach with regard to resilience. While we have taken pains to scope the relevant issues as much as possible, we have tried to capture a portrait of resilience with the paints of a process’ existence, scope, quality, and decision-making strength. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has provided financial markets with a framework for the clear, comparable, and relevant communication of climate-related issues to financial actors. It’s use of the term ‘resilience’ in the context of climate change has given the term a more defined and approachable scope. Firstly, the TCFD’s acknowledgment of resilience as an opportunity in the face of climate-related risks positions resilience as more of a dynamic process of developing rather than a static threshold of post-development. “The concept of climate resilience involves organizations developing adaptive capacity to respond to climate change to better manage the associated risks and seize opportunities, including the ability to respond to transition risks and physical risks. Opportunities include improving efficiency, designing new production processes, and developing new products. Opportunities related to resilience may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets or extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically on utility and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain; and those that may require longer-term financing and investment.” Secondly, the TCFD’s use of resilience in its recommended disclosure Strategy (c) infers that same action-oriented understanding of resilience. “Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.” You’ll notice that the recommended disclosure does not read “Describe whether or not the organization’s strategy is resilient…” Finally, the way resilience is used throughout the TCFD report allows us to use the TCFD structure itself as a useful framework for thinking about climate resilience. In the same way that climate-related issues should be disclosed in a way that it addresses elements of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, reporting on climate resilience can leverage a similar structure. Thus, the four pillars of the TCFD provide a comprehensive lens to view climate-related resilience. This does not mean that risks associated with social elements are not real or not important. On the contrary, vast evidence demonstrates that low-income communities, communities of color, low-wage workers, isolated populations and many others are at greater risk because they already lack the resources to respond to climate impacts or to recover from disasters. It is essential for capital to flow in ways that support local communities. However, this requirement is generally seen as a priority for public policy instead of capital. Financial interests alone are unlikely to direct sufficient resources into underserved communities, as returns are often perceived to be more limited. Few mechanisms exist to allow investors to directly capitalize on social co-benefits, although programs and funds are emerging to help investors do just that. Our experience with the concept of social risk within the Resilience Module helped us understand its challenges and shaped our decisions for the future. Social risk, as it evolved throughout the course of the Resilience Module, tended to be a catch-all of everything that did not fall into the well-defined categories of transition risk and physical risk. The initial version of the Resilience Module (2018) looked at a broad range of disruptions and asked companies to consider risk from what, and to whom? The alignment with TCFD meant that the “to whom” question no longer fit and was therefore placed into a separate section. This created confusion, as social dimensions of risk cannot be separated cleanly from physical or transition risks. Various transition risks and physical risks were even at times portrayed as social risks in an effort to address all three categories. Without a clearer understanding of what social risk entails, the category lost its utility in its primary purpose of informing the identification, assessment, and management of those risks. Furthermore, while the TCFD provided a framework for translating transition and physical risks into impacts, no such widely understood and accepted framework is yet available for the translation of social risks. Without such a framework, the identification, assessment, and management of social risks, while no less important, are not as easily communicated to, or accessible by, investors attempting to build resilience into their decision-making processes and overall strategies. Finally, GRESB already captures a strong foundation of data on various aspects relating to social capability, performance, objectives, and management within its core Assessments. The building of such capabilities may indeed lead to more resilient entities. The “S” in ESG continues to be a core element on which GRESB seeks to provide actionable insights. The articles in this series on lessons learned from the Resilience Module will provide insights on what was revealed from results over the last three years. Notably, it will illustrate key concepts and what best practice looks like. The goal is to keep advancing the state of practice by helping investors to ask better questions and demonstrating what good answers look like.

The index boosts the specialist offering of the parent GLIO Index, whose principles are to capture companies engaged in activities critical for the day-to-day functioning of society and the global economy. The index arrives at a key juncture, when investors are increasingly aware of the importance of coherent climate and ESG goals. It will: Expand upon the parent GLIO Index Use GRESB’s annual infrastructure Public Disclosure scores to weight constituents Be managed by global real assets index specialist GPR, registered under EU Benchmark Regulations (BMR) To enter the GLIO index, companies must derive 75% of EBITDA from the following infrastructure groups: Energy Transportation & Storage, Communications Infrastructure, Transportation, Renewable Energy and Regulated Network Utilities. The GLIO Index eligible infrastructure sectors are based on the broader industry standard EDHECInfra TICCS® classification system. The GRESB Public Disclosure offers investors a unique tool to evaluate the transparency of sustainability disclosures as seen on the websites, sustainability reports and annual reports of infrastructure companies in the GLIO Index. The evaluation covers: sustainability governance, sustainability implementation, operational performance data, and stakeholder engagement practices. Each constituent is scored on the above areas and the scores combined are applied in a 10% banding system to calculate a final weight in the index. Scores are updated in November on an annual basis. The GLIO/GRESB ESG Index can serve as the basis for institutional asset mandates and exchange traded funds (ETFs). In addition, GPR has 25 years-experience in index customization which enables investors to tailor their investment strategies while using the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index as the backbone. The index also provides an essential tool for investors to engage with constituent companies on improving public disclosure and transparency going forward. The GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is the first ESG focused index in the listed infrastructure space. Manoj Patel, Chairman of the GLIO Index Committee, said: “The launch of the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is leap forward in the sophistication of the asset class, aimed at encouraging better ESG disclosure. We see this as a move towards better ESG engagement with companies, enabling investors to benchmark through an ESG lens.” Manoj Patel, Chairman of the GLIO Index Committee, said: “The launch of the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is leap forward in the sophistication of the asset class, aimed at encouraging better ESG disclosure.

The strategy will be developed jointly by GRESB BV and GRESB Foundation to ensure we consistently understand and incorporate the needs of our Members and Partners into our decision-making processes and plans for the future. Following the restructuring of the Assessments last year, the industry is seeking stability for 2021. Mindful of this, 2021 Assessments changes will be incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and continue to support the move to a greater emphasis on ESG performance and outcomes over the next few years. Our focus has been on standardising reporting, increasing alignment with external frameworks and regulations, improving reporting efficiencies and quality control, and strengthening our analytical capabilities to deliver more ESG insights from the existing dataset. 2021 Infrastructure Assessments The 2021 Infrastructure Assessments have already been made available in pre-release. The (TCFD aligned) Resilience Module, which was previously optional, has been integrated in the Management Components of the Fund and Asset Assessments. New metrics have been added to the Asset Performance Component based on alignment with other frameworks and input from stakeholders. The full Reference Guide and Scoring Document will be released on March 1, 2021. Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-release Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-release 2021 Real Estate Assessment The 2021 Real Estate Assessment Pre-release will be made available on March 1, together with the Reference Guide and Scoring Document, following feedback from Assessment participants and consultation with the Real Estate Advisory Board and regional Benchmark Committees. As with previous years, the Assessment Portal will open on April 1, marking the start of the 2021 reporting period. See the 2021 Assessment timeline. With the world waking up to the need to rapidly transition to a more sustainable and resilient future, the interest in ESG data and benchmarks is intensifying. As stewards of the global ESG benchmarks for the real asset industry, our role is to ensure our members have access to reliable and comparable ESG data and benchmarks to understand the sustainability performance of their assets and portfolios; communicate, engage and coordinate effectively; and ultimately make decisions that lead to positive social and environmental outcomes. We are developing a long-term strategy in consultation with the industry to guide our collective effort. The initial steps for this work are set out below. These will weave into the activities of the GRESB Foundation, which is due to become fully operational by April 2021. The Foundation will govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based, ensuring they remain independent and reflective of the industry and members they represent.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-2020-with-crisis-comes-opportunity/,GRESB Newsletter | 2020: With crisis comes opportunity,"2020: With crisis comes opportunity Amid all the disruption and uncertainty of the year, we witnessed a great upswing in ESG transparency and collaboration from across the real asset industry. ESG issues are nothing new of course, but the crisis has intensified them and underlined how critical it is to build resilience for systemic problems like the climate crisis, social inequality, and biodiversity loss. 2020 also saw regulators taking up the ESG baton like never before, and investors demanding ever more granular, standardised and validated data to enhance their risk management and investment processes. These forces have the power to align the markets with the ecological, social and economic systems on which they depend, and ultimately shape a more sustainable and resilient world. This is the opportunity we are planning for and we are committed to doing our part to support the industry through these historic times. Following last month’s announcement about the changes to GRESB’s governance, we are in the final stages of setting up the GRESB Foundation as a legal entity. We recognize the importance of working closely with all our stakeholders over the next few months to ensure we establish the right structures and engagement processes under the Foundation. This design stage is crucial and the intention is for the GRESB Foundation to become fully operational by April 2021, with the right arrangements in place in time to oversee the development of the 2022 GRESB Standards. The existing Advisory Bodies and Benchmark Committees will remain in place in the interim period to oversee the release of the 2021 Assessments. We have published the 2021 Assessments timeline on gresb.com. The key milestones include: December 2020: 2021 Infrastructure Assessments Pre-release March: 2021 Real Estate Assessment Pre-release April 1: GRESB Portal opens July 1: Portal closes September 1: Preliminary release of 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Results September: Results Review Period October 1: Release 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Results October: Public results events As this year draws to a close we would like to offer you our best wishes for the holiday season and thank you for all your collaboration, insight and support for our work in 2020. Kind regards,GRESB The 2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments are available in Pre-release The 2021 Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and input from our governance groups. This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps to move the entire industry closer to a shared vision of sustainable real assets. The 2021 Assessment changes will provide further alignment with external frameworks, enable us to enhance our analytical tools and support our efforts to improve the quality of the ESG data available to the industry. 2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Pre-release2021 Assessment Development Process The upcoming EU regulations are a significant development for the real assets sector. The most important regulations are the EU Taxonomy (EU-T), the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). These regulations will require a step change from the industry in terms of transparency as it pertains to environmental, social and governance criteria and the need for more aligned, comprehensive and quality ESG reporting. GRESB is committed to helping its members address these regulations. GRESB recognises that these new regulations represent a challenge to the industry and that GRESB Members and Partners have considerable expertise in addressing such challenges. We therefore invite Members and Partners to express their interest in collaborating on EU regulatory reporting and assessment. This is intended to be on a voluntary basis, with recognition provided for input.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2021-gresb-infrastructure-assessments-development/,2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Development,"GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real assets, providing standardized and validated data to capital markets. We were established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to reliable data on the ESG performance of their real estate investments. In 2015, a group of ten founding infrastructure investors came together to establish the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments. Since then GRESB has grown to become the leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. 2021 Assessments available in Pre-release: Download Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-release Download Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-release Following last month’s announcement about the changes to GRESB’s governance, we are in the final stages of setting up the independent GRESB Foundation to own and govern the GRESB Standards on which the Assessments are based. All GRESB Members and Partners will be part of the Foundation. The Foundation Board will have broad representation from across GRESB Investor Members to ensure that the Standards remain investor-led, mission-driven and responsive to investor needs. We recognize the importance of working closely with all our stakeholders over the next few months to ensure we establish the right structures and engagement processes under the Foundation. This design stage is crucial and the intention is for the GRESB Foundation to become fully operational by April 2021, with the right arrangements in place in time to oversee the development of the 2022 GRESB Standards. The existing Advisory Bodies and Benchmark Committees will remain in-place in the interim period to oversee the release of the 2021 Assessments, as outlined below. 2021 Assessments Development Process The annual Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and input from our governance groups as described conceptually in the figure below. This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps to move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. April – November 2020: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved: Mapping ESG topics and metrics covered by other reporting standards and frameworks relevant to our stakeholders; Identifying areas of potential alignment between those topics and our Assessment; Reviewing and analysing the current responses to all indicators; Reviewing feedback provided by participants; Reviewing which indicators and metrics were of limited analytical value or of limited interest to investors, and evaluating whether these would be kept or amended. October 2020 – December 2020: Engagement with our governance groups, the Infrastructure Advisory Board and the Infrastructure Benchmark Committee, to discuss the proposed changes and to generate further input into the Assessments. December 2020: Incorporating the final comments and publishing the pre-release of the 2021 Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments. Mindful of how the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments have developed over the last five years, changes this year are incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and ready to support the move to a greater focus on performance over the next few years. The Resilience Module, which was previously optional, has been integrated in the Management Components of the Fund and Asset Assessments and is aligned with TCFD reporting. New metrics have been added to the Asset Performance Component based on alignment with other frameworks and input from stakeholders. The Fund Assessment will still consist of a Management Component only, with the scores of the fund’s underlying assets informing the fund’s performance score. The Asset Assessment will comprise a Management and Performance Component. The 2021 Assessment changes will provide further alignment with external frameworks, enable us to enhance our analytical tools and support our efforts to improve the quality of the ESG data available to the industry. Infrastructure Fund The Fund Assessment has been reviewed and the Resilience Module has been integrated. As in 2020, the Fund Assessment will consist of a Management Component, called the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund, which is aligned to the Asset Assessment’s Management Component – Infrastructure Asset. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Fund will simply comprise the Asset Assessments for the underlying assets. The Management Component – Infrastructure Fund consists of five aspects: Leadership Policies Reporting Risk Management Stakeholder Engagement New indicators have been added in the Risk Management aspect as part of the Resilience integration. These new indicators will not be scored in 2020. Two indicators in the Leadership aspect have been adapted to suit the Resilience integration. For alignment reasons, some metrics have been added, changed or removed. Funds completing the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund will obtain a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Fund. If more than 25% of their underlying assets complete both the Asset Management and Performance Components, the average aggregated GRESB Scores for those assets will provide the Performance Component Score for the Infrastructure Fund. Infrastructure Asset The Resilience Module has also been integrated into the Asset Assessment’s Management Component. As in the 2020 Assessments, the Management Component will focus on management and processes and be pitched at the organizational level. The Performance Component will focus on measuring performance, include performance indicators and certifications and be pitched at the asset level. The Management Component is suitable for any type of infrastructure company, asset and investment strategy. It is validated, scored and peer-benchmarked using the globally recognized GRESB methodology, and can be completed individually or in combination with the Performance Components. The Management Component – Infrastructure Asset consists of five aspects. The aspects align with the Fund Assessment; Leadership Policies Reporting Risk Management Stakeholder Engagement Several indicators were amended, from slight name changes, added or removed metrics, to changes to the structure of indicators. New indicators were added to the Risk Management aspect as part of the Resilience integration. These new indicators will not be scored in 2021. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset comprises twelve aspects: Implementation Output & Impact Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions Air Pollution Water Waste Biodiversity & Habitat Health & Safety Employees Customers Certifications & Awards As part of the process to score performance in addition to transparency, the aspect Output & Impact has been made mandatory for any assets completing the Performance Component. This enables GRESB to provide intensity metrics for the quantitative indicators in the Performance Component. New metrics have been added to some of the indicators to align with external frameworks. None of the new metrics are scored. 2021 Pre-Release The 2021 Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments are available in pre-release versions here. While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2021 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2021 Infrastructure Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications."

Here are the latest updates: Last week, we made an exciting announcement about our future covering three important changes to GRESB. First, we are establishing an independent GRESB Foundation to own and govern the GRESB Standards on which the Assessments are based. All GRESB members and partners will be part of the Foundation. The Foundation Board will have broad representation from across GRESB Investor Members to ensure that the Standards remain investor-led, mission-driven and responsive to investor needs. The existing Real Estate and Infrastructure Advisory Boards and Benchmark Committees (renamed as Standards Boards and Standards Committees respectively) will be formalized under the governance of the Foundation and continue to oversee the development and maintenance of the Standards. We aim to have the GRESB Foundation, and its governance and committees, in place by year end 2020. Second, GRESB BV will become a benefit corporation and seek formal B-Corp certification to ensure accountability for our mission over the long term. We will move to a dual board governance structure with a Supervisory Board and Management Board. The Supervisory board will guide the Management Board and ensure we fulfil our mission. Third, supported by our investment partner, Summit Partners, we will invest in our data science and technology capabilities, expand the benchmark coverage and improve our processes so that we can better support our members and partners in their reporting efforts. ​​​​Read the announcement We’re pleased to announce that 2020 GRESB results for Infrastructure and Real Estate are now out. We would like to congratulate all our members and partners for taking part in the benchmark and thank all our stakeholders for their support and collaboration as we worked through the challenges of this year’s results release period.

The Public Disclosure Levels (ranked from A to E) are now available in the GRESB Portal. GRESB Investor Members use this data to compare the ESG transparency of listed companies. It is also being used by a growing number of ESG indices using GRESB data, including the new GLIO/GRESB INDEX, the first specialist global listed infrastructure ESG focused index being launched later this year. This year’s Sustainable Investing Report from Infrastructure Investor considers how covid-19 could be the catalyst for a green future; how to promote good governance; and looks at LPs leading the climate change charge – plus much more. Rick Walters, GRESB’s Director Infrastructure wrote an article for the report commenting on the readiness of the Infrastructure asset class for the coming EU regulations.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/participation-in-the-2020-gresb-real-estate-benchmark-leaps-22-amid-accelerating-investor-demand-for-esg-data/,Participation in the 2020 GRESB Real Estate Benchmark leaps 22% amid accelerating investor demand for ESG data,"AMSTERDAM, (November 24, 2020): GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2020 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Participation in the 2020 Assessment grew by 22% to cover 1,229 portfolios (2019: 1,005) worth more than USD $4.8 trillion AUM. Data on key environmental performance indicators was reported at asset-level for more than 96,000 assets, across 64 countries, and aggregated to portfolio-level. This increase in participation, coming despite the challenges of the covid-19 crisis, shows an industry responding decisively to the accelerating investor demand for comparable ESG data. The private sector led the growth trend, with participation growing 32% to cover 953 non-listed portfolios (2019: 723). On the listed side, 271 REITs and property companies reported to GRESB (2019: 240), an increase of 13% on the previous year. 2020 marked an inflection point for the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. We introduced mandatory asset-level data reporting to improve data quality and implemented a new reporting structure that placed a higher weighting((The Performance Component accounts for 70% of the total GRESB Score in 2020)) on the Performance Component towards the overall GRESB Score. This benchmark-wide score reset resulted in the average GRESB Score falling to 70 (2019: 72). While the changes to the reporting structure and scoring weights make it difficult to draw detailed comparisons with previous years, several trend lines remain: Listed property companies still outperform the private sector, but with a smaller lead than previous years. The average GRESB Score for standing investments portfolios is 71 for listed companies and 70 for private entities. For development portfolios, the differences are slightly larger and favor the private sector – listed companies have an average score of 73, compared to 75 for private entities. By sector, average GRESB Scores for offices continue to outperform other property types, but the other sectors are closing in. The regional breakdown shows Oceania still ahead, with an average GRESB Score of 77. The Asian real estate sector comes in second, with 72, followed by Europe at 69.5, just slightly ahead of the Americas at 69. Once again, Europe leads the world in transparency with the highest number of new entities participating in the benchmark, while the Americas cohort remains the largest in dollar terms globally. Americas is also the only region where the average score for the private sector (70) is higher than the listed sector (67). In 2020, thanks to asset-level data reporting, we are able to provide granular calculations of energy, GHG and water use intensities by entity and property type. The values are shared in the individual Benchmark Reports for guidance purposes. We will be engaging closely with the industry to agree on the development of the calculation methodology for future years. GRESB is part of the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) project and the CRREM Tool aligns closely with the performance data reported in the 2020 Assessment. Our early analysis of participants who were able to provide 100% data coverage in Europe shows that average GHG intensity of participants exceeds the CRREM 2C pathway by 2035, and the 1.5C pathway as early as 2027. After last year’s increase in like-for-like energy consumption, this year we observe a global reduction of 2%. This decrease can be seen across all regions, with Europe having the largest reduction of 3.2%. Global GHG emissions and water consumption also fell by 3% and 1.5%, respectively. Participation in the 2020 Real Estate Assessment grew significantly from last year to cover 1,229 real estate portfolios worth more than US 4.8 trillion AUM. While we still have many challenges to overcome on our way to a more sustainable future, it’s inspiring to see this collective commitment to ESG transparency and collaboration from across the global real estate industry.” says Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/a-new-era-for-gresb-building-on-strong-foundations/,A new era for GRESB – Building on strong foundations,"AMSTERDAM, (November 16, 2020, 16:00 CET) – GRESB Management is pleased to announce that it has partnered with Summit Partners to acquire GRESB from GBCI. The GRESB team would like to thank GBCI for the support it has provided over the last six years to advance sustainable real assets and for allowing us to take this next step in our journey. This new ownership allows us to establish an independent, non-profit foundation – the GRESB Foundation (or “Foundation”) – to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based. The Foundation Board will be constituted from GRESB Investor Members and will be responsible for reviewing and approving the Standards on an annual basis to ensure they remain investor-led and aligned with responsible investment principles. “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by industry, for industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization. I look forward to serving on the Foundation Board alongside my former GRESB non-executive director colleagues – Deborah Ng, Head of Responsible Investing and Director, Total Fund Management, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and Mathieu Elshout Senior Director Private Real Estate, PGGM Investments – and other members.” “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by industry, for industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2020-results-infrastructure-sector-maturing-its-approach-to-esg-reporting-and-benchmarking/,GRESB 2020 Results: Infrastructure sector maturing its approach to ESG reporting and benchmarking,"AMSTERDAM, (November 12, 2020): GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2020 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 crisis, participation has increased again in 2020 as the sector responds to the growing investor demand for standardized and validated ESG data to monitor the sustainability of their infrastructure funds and assets. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew to 75 funds completing both components – obtaining a GRESB Fund Score reflecting overall ESG performance at the portfolio level – and 118 completing the Management Component. The Assessment now covers 32% of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers, and 38% of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50 – participating with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment increased by 8% to cover 426 assets and 1,354 facilities. The Assessment now covers 32 of the 33 industry sectors across 59 countries, leading to deep data insights for investors, fund managers and asset operators. The Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset provides comprehensive coverage of listed infrastructure companies including the GLIO Global Coverage Index (234 companies in total). The data reveals which listed infrastructure companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which perform in the mid-range and which are lagging their peers. In an exciting new development, this data will be used in a GLIO/GRESB Index to be launched by year end. 98 assets and 28 funds participated in the Resilience Module (a 60% increase). The module is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The continued growth in participation demonstrates an increasing investor attention on climate risks and resilience. The big news this year is the leap in scores for both Funds and Assets. Overall GRESB Scores, and Component Scores, increased by 10 to 15 points on average. Only two funds saw their scores decrease. Funds are improving so much that thirteen funds scored the maximum 100 for the Management Component. In the case of Assets, for the first time in GRESB history (including Real Estate), one asset scored a maximum 100 for their overall GRESB Score. This shows that the industry is maturing in its approach to ESG and is strongly focused on improving performance. GRESB Fund Model (Component Scores) GRESB Asset Model (Component Scores) 75 funds participated in the Assessment with more than 25% of their assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score, which is the overall measure of ESG performance at the portfolio level. The average GRESB Fund Score increased to 65 points, from 55 in 2019. The average score also increased in the Asset Assessment, from 48 in 2019 to 61 in 2020. Participation was stable across most sectors in the Asset Assessment, but notably Data Infrastructure grew from 21 to 38 – likely reflecting the growing importance of this sector during the Covid crisis. The best-scoring sector continues to be Network Utilities (with an average score of 73), closely followed by Power Generation x-Renewables (72) and Renewable Power (69). While Social Infrastructure came in with the lowest average score again this year (47), it also posted one of the largest score increases (+18), narrowing the gap with other sectors. The scores for the two energy generation sectors (Power Generation x-Renewables and Renewable Power) showed the biggest increases (+25 and +20 respectively). There are clear regional differences in participation rates and performance. Europe-focused funds are the largest contingent, followed by Globally Diversified. Europe also has the largest number of participating assets (60%), but the lowest average asset score (57). Average scores across Americas, Asia and Oceania are all similar at around 67. “Now in its fifth year, we are delighted to see the maturing of the infrastructure industry in its approach to ESG, and focus on improving performance. Despite the clear challenges presented by the Covid-19 crisis, participation in GRESB still grew, and scores leapt by 10 to 15 points on average for both Funds and Assets. We even saw a GRESB first achieved, with one asset achieving a GRESB score of the maximum 100! We acknowledge the extra challenges faced this year, and we thank the new and returning participants for their diligence and commitment to reporting and engaging on ESG.” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We look forward to supporting our participant and investor members to use their benchmark results to support the transformation towards sustainable infrastructure. Infrastructure development is proving a strong feature of pandemic recovery plans across the globe, and proper integration of ESG in infrastructure investment provides the best assurance that the recovery will be effective and fair. It will enable issues like climate change and inequality to be addressed so that as we come out of this crisis, we are on our way to addressing and preventing the next, and building a better and fairer world.” “Now in its fifth year, we are delighted to see the maturing of the infrastructure industry in its approach to ESG, and focus on improving performance.

You can also read the article below. New data streams providing asset-level intelligence are revolutionising sustainable finance in the real estate sector, but there is still a critical need for more harmonisation and benchmarking when it comes to ESG data. That was the main message from experts gathered for the third annual (and this time digital) Nordea GRESB Green Building Forum on September 25. The event drew in over 100 participants, bringing together leading investors, real estate companies and other market experts to discuss the substantial shift currently underway in real estate financing. The real estate sector both affects and is affected by climate change. It is responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions, roughly 40% when considering both direct and indirect emissions, according to Marco Kisic, Head of ESG Research at Nordea. The industry will have to undergo a “very significant” transformation in order to meet the targets set forth in the Paris Agreement, he told the audience. In Europe, a host of regulations and policies are driving that change, from the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the EU Green Deal to the EU Sustainability Taxonomy. “By starting to act now and plan ahead, companies have the opportunity to get ahead of the competition and get in a strong position before regulation is even tighter than where it is now,” Kisic said. “By starting to act now and plan ahead, companies have the opportunity to get ahead of the competition and get in a strong position before regulation is even tighter than where it is now,” Kisic said. The experts presenting at the forum made it clear that a strong ESG performance can influence corporate performance. In one breakout session, Anna Denell, Head of Sustainability at Swedish real estate company Vasakronan, presented four compelling reasons why real estate companies should focus on ESG performance: Lowering your environmental and climate impact typically leads to saved resources, which usually means saved money. Certified green buildings are easier to lease, often offering benefits such as improved air quality, reduced noise and better light, which can help attract and retain tenants. Appraisers have started to implement a yield shift for certified assets. Going green is the best way to lower the price of your funding. Denell noted that Vasakronan currently has 85% of its assets certified. Presenters from S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service also shed light on how ESG factors are incorporated into their frameworks for corporate credit ratings in real estate. Manish Kejriwal from S&P noted that environmental credit factors are becoming increasingly relevant, affecting such parameters as asset quality, business strategy as well as cash flow and profitability. When asked about the quality of the ESG data he has to work with when assessing credit ratings, Kejriwal described the current state of disclosure as inadequate. “Companies are disclosing data, but key performance indicators are missing,” he said, pointing to value chain data as one missing component. “Companies are disclosing data, but key performance indicators are missing,” he said, pointing to value chain data as one missing component. Part of the problem with ESG data is that only a relatively small percentage of real assets are certified and that the certifications are so different, according to Nordea’s Kisic. He noted that companies have made massive strides over the past 10 years when it comes to ESG disclosures, particularly in the Nordics, but there is still ground to cover, and a gap persists between large and small caps. As part of Nordea’s Taxonomy work, Kisic has tried to map the different certifications available in the Nordics to the criteria in the EU Sustainability Taxonomy, an exercise Kisic described as “incredibly complicated.” “We’re going to need some unification going forward. The Taxonomy is hopefully a first step in that direction,” he said. “We’re going to need some unification going forward. The Taxonomy is hopefully a first step in that direction,” he said. Since its founding over 10 years ago, GRESB has been driving a collaborative effort to define standardized metrics and develop a consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance of real assets. In the past, GRESB only gathered data at the portfolio level from asset managers and passed that along to investors. Five years ago, the organisation started looking at the underlying, asset-level data. In 2020, reporting on such asset-level data became mandatory for all GRESB participants. Those disclosures are used to inform the data that’s passed on to institutional investors. The GRESB database now covers around 96,000 assets and includes specific data on criteria such as building certifications, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste. “Once the data comes together in a structured way, we will be able to make some meaningful conclusions at a structural level,” said Josien Piek, Head of EMEA at GRESB and a co-host of the event. “Once the data comes together in a structured way, we will be able to make some meaningful conclusions at a structural level,” said Josien Piek, Head of EMEA at GRESB and a co-host of the event. For companies that report their asset-level data to GRESB, that data can be easily integrated with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology, which breaks down high-level Paris Agreement goals into country-level, sub-sector and building-specific carbon transition pathways. “It’s revolutionary that the business community is now picking up something that’s a collective goal and doing it in a diligent and fast manner,” Piek added. “It’s revolutionary that the business community is now picking up something that’s a collective goal and doing it in a diligent and fast manner,” Piek added. In one breakout session, Derk Welling, Senior Responsible Investment & Governance Specialist at APG Asset Management, explained how pension manager APG has adopted the strategy of looking for more detailed certified asset-level data, imposing BREEAM In-Use certification across its complete portfolio in Europe for non-listed investments. “A green certification scheme means to us that the environmental performance has been measured against a certain standard. And since each BREEAM certificate comes with over 100 questions, we indirectly can get access to a lot of additional asset-level data,” he said. “A green certification scheme means to us that the environmental performance has been measured against a certain standard. And since each BREEAM certificate comes with over 100 questions, we indirectly can get access to a lot of additional asset-level data,” he said. The regulatory landscape around ESG data is also rapidly evolving. Bahar Yay Celik from INREV presented the ins and outs of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, set to take effect in Europe in March 2021 with the aim of reorienting capital towards sustainable investment. The regulation covers financial market participants and financial advisors; companies with more than 500 employees and all firms that market funds into the EU, requiring both entity and product-level disclosures. The legislation is expected to indirectly have a global impact on the whole value chain. Jacob Michaelsen, Head of Sustainable Finance Advisory at Nordea and co-host of the event, summed up the main takeaways from the day: “Today’s forum makes it clear that to really supercharge the shift currently underway, we need harmonisation on ESG data and benchmarking as well as regulation that supports that.” Jacob Michaelsen, Head of Sustainable Finance Advisory at Nordea and co-host of the event, summed up the main takeaways from the day: “Today’s forum makes it clear that to really supercharge the shift currently underway, we need harmonisation on ESG data and benchmarking as well as regulation that supports that.” Watch the recording from the event: Information on the Breakout room videos:Breakout 1 Asset owner perspective on working with ESG data (Derk Welling, Senior Responsible Investment Specialist at APG Asset Management) – Included in the video above at minute 1:21:46Breakout 2: Asset manager perspective on working with ESG data (Anna Denell, Sustainability Director, Vasakronan) – Available here: https://youtu.be/uQXzlH7kGdc Breakout 3: Technical perspective on asset-level ESG data (Erik Landry, Climate Change Specialist, GRESB) – Available here: https://youtu.be/NmNOGgiKdSo Read more from Nordea: https://insights.nordea.com/en/"

The Asia Pacific Embodied Carbon Primer raises awareness on what embodied carbon is, where it occurs throughout a building and infrastructure asset’s lifecycle and how tackling embodied carbon can catalyse Asia Pacific to building back better post COVID-19. It sets out key actions that can be taken today by business, government and civil society to raise awareness, set ambitions, drive demand and make substantial progress in reducing embodied carbon of projects, materials and products. 60% of the world’s population currently live in the Asia Pacific region and the region is projected to have significant growth and new buildings and infrastructure over the coming decades. It is also one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change. Of the 4.3 billion people living in Asia Pacific, more than 2 billion live in urban areas. Projections show this will increase to 3.3 billion by 2050. With such a large projected growth, mitigating embodied carbon emissions over the coming years is essential to ensuring a high quality of life, minimising the negative impacts on the environment, and maximising economic opportunities to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly low carbon economy. Victoria Burrows, Director, Advancing Net Zero, World Green Building Council “In 2018 alone, almost half of the world’s 281 natural disaster events occurred in the Asia Pacific region including 8 of the 10 deadliest with an increasing number of these events being linked to environmental degradation and climate change. The built environment sector can provide powerful solutions to the climate crisis. With buildings responsible for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions and building stock expected to double by 2050, the time to act is now. To achieve net zero targets by mid-century and sustain predicted growth and urbanisation, we must decarbonise the whole lifecycle of our built assets — buildings and infrastructure. If we act now, great opportunity awaits for Asia Pacific to create economic benefits, competitiveness advantage and minimise the consequences of catastrophic climate change.” “In 2018 alone, almost half of the world’s 281 natural disaster events occurred in the Asia Pacific region including 8 of the 10 deadliest with an increasing number of these events being linked to environmental degradation and climate change.

If we act now, great opportunity awaits for Asia Pacific to create economic benefits, competitiveness advantage and minimise the consequences of catastrophic climate change.” To truly tackle the climate crisis, the report calls for the building and construction sector to embrace a whole lifecycle approach to carbon emissions. This means not only the emissions released during operation (energy to heat, cool and power buildings) but also during the manufacturing, transportation, construction, maintenance, repair and end of life phases known as ‘embodied carbon’. These emissions contribute around 11% of all global energy-related carbon emissions and 28% of building sector emissions. The carbon emissions released before the building or infrastructure begins to be used, sometimes called upfront carbon, will be responsible for half of the entire carbon footprint of new construction between now and 2050, threatening to consume a large part of the world’s remaining carbon budget. Addressing embodied carbon in buildings and infrastructure can help build back better, reinforce the business case for net zero, renew tradition and encourage innovation, provide new forms of incentives and futureproof global competitiveness.Read the report on WorldGBC’s website.

This increase comes despite the pressures of the Covid-19 pandemic and is testament to an industry-wide commitment to ESG transparency and collaborative action on sustainability. The 2020 ESG benchmark now covers more than US $5.3 trillion AuM (2019: 4.5 trillion), giving clarity and direction to the real asset investment market as a means to address complex sustainability challenges. GRESB data is used by hundreds of capital providers and thousands of asset managers to benchmark investments across portfolios and understand the opportunities, risks and choices that need to be made as the industry transitions to a more sustainable future. The benchmarks also provide an objective reference point on national and regional performance and help to track industry progress against normative guidelines such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals; decarbonization pathways such as those defined by Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for the real estate sector and emerging disclosure regulations including the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU ESG Regulations. 1,229 (2019: 1,005) property companies, REITs, private equity funds and real estate developers participated in the 2020 Real Estate Assessment, generating a benchmark that covers US $4.8 trillion AuM (2019: 4.1 trillion). Data on key environmental performance indicators is reported at asset level and covers more than 96,000 assets, across 64 countries. The data combines high-level overall scores with in-depth information across hundreds of ESG metrics, including performance indicators such as energy consumption, GHG emissions, water consumption and waste. For private market investors, the GRESB benchmark covers 957 (2019: 723) non-listed funds, representing 79 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Global Real Estate Investment Managers who participate with at least one fund and 46 of PERE 100: institutional capital’s top manager picks. The listed dataset covers 272 (2019: 240) publicly-traded property companies and REITs globally, representing 61% coverage of the major developed listed real estate indices. Adding the GRESB Public Disclosure Dataset results in full coverage of the major listed real estate indices. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment increased by 10% to cover 118 funds (2019: 107) and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 8% to include 426 assets (2019: 393). The Infrastructure Benchmark now represents US $576 billion AuM (2019: 471 billion), covering 32 of the 34 industry sectors across 40 countries. To add market context to these numbers, 32% of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers, and 38% of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50 participate in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment, with at least one portfolio or asset. And the Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset has full coverage of the GLIO Global Coverage Index (170 listed infrastructure companies with a US $2.7 trillion total market cap). 534 entities (comprising 408 real estate entities, 98 infrastructure assets, and 28 infrastructure funds) participated in the Resilience Module, a 69% increase from the previous year. This year marks the third and final year of the Resilience Module as a voluntary supplement for the Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. In 2021 the Resilience Module will be integrated into the core Assessments forming part of the required reporting set. The Module indicators, in coordination with the core Assessments, cover all TCFD recommendations helping investors to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and resilience efforts across real asset companies and funds around the world. “With accelerating sustainability risks, accessing standardized and reliable ESG data and benchmarks has never been more important to investors,” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets.” “With accelerating sustainability risks, accessing standardized and reliable ESG data and benchmarks has never been more important to investors,” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets.” “We also owe a great debt to current and past members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today.” “We also owe a great debt to current and past members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today.” The transition to a sustainable real asset industry is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, meaningful global benchmarks and collective action from all stakeholders working towards a sustainable future. We hope you will join us for our online Public Results Events taking place the week beginning November 9, 2020, and thank you for being part of the movement.

For more coverage information, please see our press release. The validation process conducted by GBCI is now underway. We estimate more than 38,000 (2019: 31,000) human validation decisions will be taken this year to ensure the quality of the reported data in preparation for scoring and benchmarking. This manual validation complements the automated checks on information completeness, accuracy and reporting rules integrated in the Portal. In parallel, the real estate team is conducting a reporting boundaries review to ensure portfolios have full coverage of their underlying assets. New this year, we have introduced a Review Period to further strengthen the reliability of the benchmark results. Participants can make official requests for validation and scoring reviews between October 1 – when their preliminary benchmark reports will be available – and October 15. Assessments and scores can then be updated until October 22. See the details of the Review Period The launch of final 2020 Assessment results and benchmarks, to both Participants and Investor Members, will take place on November 1. The public results events will follow a week later, starting November 9, 2020. These will be online and take place at different time zones to cover the main regions. Look out for more details on the program coming soon. We appreciate the time and effort it takes to collect the data and report to the Assessments. It’s your commitment to transparency and industry collaboration that is driving us forward towards a more sustainable future, both individually and collectively. Thank you for your efforts. Kind regardsGRESB The new “import entities” feature allows you to add a large number of entities at one time to the Portfolio Analysis Tool. Once added, you can quickly assign custom weights for your analysis. This feature will be particularly useful for Investor Members with a subscription to listed data.

The Industry Working Group brings together GRESB Members and subject-matter experts to help shape the reporting approach for Infrastructure Assets in development (undergoing design and construction). The group looks at specific ESG issues, materiality and scoring implications and how a framework to cover Infrastructure Assets in Development best fits alongside the existing Asset Assessment, with a view to implement this in 2021. The Industry Working Group met several times over 2019 and early 2020 and a further 2-3 video calls will be held over the next 6 months, with the first taking place in September 2020. Please get in touch if you are interested in participating, or if you have any questions. Current working group members do not need to reapply. A three month long public consultation has confirmed the approach taken for the CRREM decarbonisation pathways and the final pathways for the global real estate sector are now available. Pathways will be regularly updated to ensure that the latest climate and market data are leveraged as an underlying basis. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) recently released its Net Zero Investment Framework for consultation, in which it highlights the CRREM methodology and recommends its use to determine the alignment of real estate assets with a 1.5°C pathway. As a first stage, GRESB has automated the process of filling in the CRREM Tool with the asset-level performance data uploaded to the GRESB Asset Portal. This means that GRESB Real Estate Participants can already begin to leverage their asset-level reporting to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets against the CRREM pathways for the EU28. Later stages will have a broader scope, including the new global pathways and a greater integration of asset- and portfolio-level assessment capabilities into the GRESB Portal.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/public-consultation-confirmed-approach-of-crrem-decarbonisation-pathways-for-real-estate/,Public Consultation Confirmed Approach of CRREM-Decarbonisation Pathways for Real Estate,"Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) would like to thank all market participants who took part in the public consultation phase. Industry experts, investors and scientists provided feedback on the methodology, and gave consolidated statements on the decarbonisation pathways and their usefulness in understanding as well as managing long-term climate-related transition risk in the global real estate sector. The final CRREM decarbonisation pathways for the global real estate sector are now available on www.crrem.org. Pathways will be regularly updated in the future to ensure that the latest climate and market data are leveraged as an underlying basis. Feedback from market participants During the public consultation, the CRREM team has interacted with local players and industry experts globally to ensure credibility and robustness of both the underlying methodology and the data input. Responses were received from industry experts, local investors, asset managers, industry bodies, green building councils, consultants and other market participants. We thank all participants for their valuable input and support for CRREM. Interested parties challenged outcomes to ensure market acceptance and credibility. Particularly extensive perspectives and input were obtained for the USA, UK and Japan. All consultation feedback has been exhaustively reviewed and (if needed) implemented, ensuring alignment with industry expectations and scientific standards. Compared to the version released for consultation, the final version accounts for: Slight changes regarding starting figures for energy intensity based on additional data sources in some countries, the adoption of a more ambitious overall decarbonisation agenda in some markets and therefore more ambitious decarbonisation of energy sources over time (especially electricity), the methodology documentation was augmented, improved clarity and document structures, verification and utilization of additional country-specific sources. To date, major real estate investors like AEW, Alstria, Nordea Life & Pension, DWS, LEG, CBRE Global Investors, Castellum and many others have already successfully used and tested the CRREM tool and pathways. Investor interest in and uptake of CRREM outputs have rapidly increased due to the global outreach upon the finalization of the pathways, as well as their integration into GRESB. The upcoming release of the CRREM reporting templates and the public report “CRREM support to corporate reporting in the real estate sector” will further assist stakeholders in quantifying and disclosing climate-related risks in the real estate sector. Published results Following the public consultation period, the results have been published on the CRREM webpages. Market responses confirmed the methodology used to derive to the decarbonisation pathways, hence resulting in no material changes. The pathways will help market participants meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and other initiatives focussing on climate-related transition risk. The pathways published on the CRREM website identify annual energy- and carbon-intensity trajectories until 2050 across real estate markets and sectors that are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. CRREM covers the commercial real estate sector – including retail, offices, and logistics – as well as the residential sector, across North America, Asia-Pacific, and 28 countries in Europe. The final decarbonisation pathways for the global real estate sector will undergo revision periodically to ensure that new data sources are appropriately reflected and that the pathways remain valid and robust over time. Link to CRREM’s decarbonisation pathways Link to CRREM’s methodology Link to CRREM’s decarbonisation tool and further information CRREM participants The decarbonisation pathways were developed by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with technical support from GRESB. They were developed with the oversight of the newly instituted CRREM Scientific Advisory Committee, comprised of carefully selected academic experts with backgrounds in real estate and environmental sustainability across European, North American, and Asian markets.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/nikkei-inc-launches-a-green-reit-index-using-data-from-gresb/,Nikkei Inc. launches a green REIT Index using data from GRESB,"July 20, 2020: Nikkei Inc. has launched a new green real estate index, the “Nikkei ESG-REIT Index” which incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Responsible investment strategies are expanding globally with investors integrating ESG factors into listed real estate allocation processes. To meet this demand, Nikkei has developed a Japanese Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) index which takes ESG performance into account based on the GRESB Rating. Index constituents are selected from REITs listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and market capitalization weights are adjusted so that high-performing REITs have increased weights in the index. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB says: “GRESB supports investor demand for standardized and validated ESG performance data for real asset investments. One of the fastest growing markets for responsible investment in Asia is Japan, and most Japanese REITs report their ESG practices via the annual GRESB Assessment. The Nikkei ESG-REIT Index uses this data to track the performance of ESG leaders.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB says: “GRESB supports investor demand for standardized and validated ESG performance data for real asset investments. One of the fastest growing markets for responsible investment in Asia is Japan, and most Japanese REITs report their ESG practices via the annual GRESB Assessment. The Nikkei ESG-REIT Index uses this data to track the performance of ESG leaders.” The recent COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated existing ESG challenges such as the climate crisis, social inequality, and biodiversity loss. This has resulted in increased investor demand for ESG reporting and benchmarking to better manage risk, enhance returns and generate positive impact. “During the COVID-19 selloff, investors dramatically reduced their risk exposures, leading to increased inflows to listed equities that demonstrate strong ESG practices. In global equities, ESG leaders outperformed companies with poor ESG ratings by almost 7 percentage points in the first quarter of this year. It shows, once again, that responsible investment strategies provide an important protection to downside risk.” “During the COVID-19 selloff, investors dramatically reduced their risk exposures, leading to increased inflows to listed equities that demonstrate strong ESG practices.

It shows, once again, that responsible investment strategies provide an important protection to downside risk.” “A recovery that addresses acute economic issues as well as chronic environmental and social issues will require the efficient and equitable deployment of large amounts of capital. The Nikkei ESG-REIT Index allows investors to align their listed real estate investment allocation with this green recovery”, Langbroek concludes. “A recovery that addresses acute economic issues as well as chronic environmental and social issues will require the efficient and equitable deployment of large amounts of capital.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/get-asset-specific-physical-climate-risk-exposure-data-and-benchmarks-in-the-gresb-portal/,Get asset-specific physical climate risk exposure data and benchmarks in the GRESB Portal,"We’ve just launched a new platform to provide you with physical climate risk exposure data directly in the GRESB Portal. Global geospatial risk provider Munich Re is first on the platform to provide asset-level intelligence across multiple climate scenarios and time frames. The physical impacts of a changing climate pose significant challenges to real assets. The chaotic nature of climatic patterns and increasing extremes — combined with the long lifetimes and limited mobility of real assets — mean that more uncertainty must be taken into account when making investment and development decisions. Understanding physical climate risks, from the asset level up, is crucial to implementing well-informed risk management practices and increasing the resilience of your portfolio. Munich Re, one of the world’s leading providers of insurance-related risk solutions, is the first data provider on the platform. Leveraging both extensive hazard databases and forward-looking climate models, Munich Re’s physical risk exposure data ranges from the present to 2100, across three different climate scenarios, at resolutions down to 30m. This flexibility and detail will help platform users to identify which of their assets are most exposed to physical climate risk, allow for long-term planning, and improve investment and development decisions. The GRESB Climate Risk Platform gives you a clear picture of portfolio exposure to a wide variety of physical climate risks. This information will help you: Identify which of your individual assets are most exposed Stress test your portfolio against multiple climate scenarios Plan for the long-term with multiple time horizons Report in line with TCFD recommendations Analyze assets for due diligence purposes When the 2020 GRESB Assessment results come out in the fall, you will be able to benchmark against peers as well as download custom reports. If you purchase climate risk data now, you’ll have the opportunity to be part of our Climate Risk Industry Working Group this summer to inform the additional analytics that will be available. The climate risk data is available for all real estate portfolios, including portfolios that do not participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Login to the Portal to view the climate risk data. Learn more about the new GRESB Climate Risk Platform or get in touch with Erik Landry, GRESB’s Climate Change Specialist, at [email protected]."

Investors have been searching for guidance, transparency and quality in this area. This new ESG DD Tool helps establish a standard ESG due diligence process for infrastructure investing. For the purpose of the ESG DD Tool, the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment for benchmarking assets has been adapted to reflect the requirements of the M&A/Investment process. The ESG DD Tool is not tied to the GRESB Assessment cycle and can be used at any time. Considering ESG driven risks and opportunities (ESG factors) before investing will help investors make more informed investment decisions. Investors typically face the following challenges in ESG due diligence: lack of a structured process to identify all potential ESG factors, difficulty in identifying the material ESG factors for any given asset, quantification of the (material) ESG risks and opportunities, which can make or break the business case of an asset. The ESG DD Tool is open source. We invite the infrastructure and investment industry to provide feedback. GRESB and B Capital Partners will update the tool in response to feedback. Being Excel based, the tool can also be readily adapted by the user to meet his/her own due diligence needs. Download the ESG DD Tool Mission-driven and investor-led, GRESB is the ESG benchmark for real assets.

The report contains insights about the state of the industry and practice from last year’s Resilience Module, leveraging a unique global dataset to provide a snapshot of the way real asset companies and funds are managing climate risk and resilience. The findings show that some firms have developed and executed relatively comprehensive programs, however, the majority of firms have partial or fragmented programs, often missing key elements, such as performance targets or operational metrics. The report covers the results from reporting real estate funds, infrastructure funds, and infrastructure assets, and breaks down the various ways in which funds are tackling the resilience challenge along the fronts of transition risk, physical risk, and social risk. It also analyzes the Module results across the four pillars used by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics & Targets This analysis provides insight into important areas for improvement, and the report provides seven actionable recommendations for investors and real asset companies working to materially improve their management of climate risk and resilience. Additional insights from the report include how leading real asset companies demonstrate innovation through a variety of resilience-related practices, which scenarios real asset firms are using to manage climate-related risks, and information on the distribution of resilience practices among top and bottom reporters. The results of this analysis have informed the development of the GRESB 2020 Resilience Module, which remains an optional supplement to the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-a-collective-industry-effort-to-advance-sustainable-real-assets/,GRESB Newsletter | A collective industry effort to advance sustainable real assets,"A collective industry effort to advance sustainable real assets As you read this newsletter we are about one third of the way through the 2020 GRESB reporting season and the GRESB Portal is filling up with real estate and infrastructure managers completing their 2020 Assessments. It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and participate in an annual benchmarking process, especially at times like these. If you haven’t started your 2020 Assessment, it’s time to login to the Portal and get your reporting underway. We have extended the submission deadline by one month this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which means you have until August 1, 2020 to complete your Assessment. Here is the updated 2020 Assessment timeline. It’s been a busy few weeks for GRESB and we’re pleased to announce the first phase of integration of the CRREM Tool into the Asset Portal, the launch of the 2019 Resilience Module Report, translations for select videos in our online training portal and a new collaboration with the World Green Building Council. Real Estate Managers: You can now identify and manage transition risks for your individual assets using the CRREM Tool in the Asset Portal Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) provides the real estate industry with transparent, science-based decarbonisation pathways aligned with the Paris Climate Goals of limiting global temperature rise to 2°C, with ambition towards 1.5°C. These pathways enable industry stakeholders to estimate carbon risk exposure and potential strategies to reduce this risk, and include the elements needed to undertake scenario analysis. As such, CRREM can be used to comply with large-scale initiatives such as the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities. The CRREM Risk Assessment Tool (CRREM Tool) is an Excel-based tool that allows users to analyse specific real estate assets, and portfolios of these assets, against the decarbonisation and energy pathways derived by the CRREM project. The tool covers commercial real estate within EU countries. As a first phase of integration, GRESB has automated the process of filling in the CRREM Tool with the asset-level performance data uploaded to the GRESB Asset Portal. This means that GRESB Participants can already begin to leverage their asset-level reporting to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets against the CRREM pathways. Later phases will have a broader scope, to include the new global pathways, and a full integration into the Asset Portal.To see the risk exposures for your assets, upload your asset-level data into the Asset Portal and click on “CRREM Tool”. Resilient Real Assets: Update from the 2019 Resilience Module We are also pleased to release Resilient Real Assets: Update from the 2019 Resilience Module. The report has insights about the state of the industry and practice from last year’s Resilience Module. It also provides updates and recommendations based on the 316 companies and funds that completed the Module.The lessons learned have informed the development of the 2020 Resilience Module. The Module now has a closer alignment with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and provides more emphasis on the identification, assessment, and management of material risks and greater detail about the use of forward-looking scenarios The 2020 Resilience Module remains an optional supplement to the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. We encourage you to complete the Module and get prepared for the questions that will be coming your way from investors and regulators.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/decarbonization-pathways-for-real-estate-available-for-public-consultation/,Decarbonization Pathways for Real Estate Available for Public Consultation,"Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) announces the public release of decarbonization pathways for the global real estate sector and the finalization of the tool to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets. The pathways will help market participants meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The downscaling pathways published today on the CRREM website identify annual energy- and carbon-intensity trajectories until 2050 across real estate markets and sectors that are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. This is a policy goal endorsed by most municipal and national governments and thereby constitutes a plausible scenario against which future climate-related transition risk can be assessed. The major investors supporting CRREM aim to establish it as a global standard for developing long-term decarbonization pathways in the real estate sector based on a transparent and scientifically rigorous methodology. CRREM covers 28 countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific across the commercial real estate sector, including retail, offices, and logistics, as well as the residential sector. GRESB, the ESG benchmark for real assets, is integrating the decarbonization pathways into its range of information resources covering ESG risks in real estate markets, and the European Commission’s high-level expert group referenced CRREM in its final report on the upcoming EU Taxonomy on sustainable finance in March. Real estate plays a major role in combatting climate change. The construction and operation of buildings accounts for 39 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions globally, and much higher percentages in densely populated urban centers. This exposes the real estate sector to significant climate-related transition risk as governments have started to impose increasingly stringent regulations on energy use and emissions from buildings to meet their own climate goals. Regulatory risk around energy and carbon is shaping market and technology trends in the real estate sector. As the temperature is projected to rise 3.8 degrees Celsius under current legislation, the decarbonization pathways aligned with 1.5- and 2-degree global carbon budgets reflect significant reduction requirements beyond current legislative requirements. CRREM estimates that the carbon-intensity of the building sector will globally have to decline from currently approx. 52 kgCO2e/m²/pa to below 10 kgCO2e/m²/pa by 2050 in order to be in line with the 2-degree global carbon budget. Such a scenario would have significant implications for long-term asset planning and risk management in the sector – especially for developed countries which in some cases are facing 100 kgCO2e/m²/pa as a starting point for office buildings (based on a whole-building approach). Calculation of the global reduction targets and the derived national targets for different asset classes in the real estate sector create added-value for investors. Added value, for example, includes the transparent analysis of carbon risks, calculation of the abatement costs and analyzing the correct timing of retrofit measures that are needed to minimize climate-related transition risk. Besides the pathways, CRREM also finalized the development of a tool to manage stranding risk for individual buildings. All information required is aligned with the information GRESB collects at the asset level in order to assess and benchmark the performance of real asset portfolios. The software is Excel-based and has undergone a significant testing phase. It is available on the crrem.eu website. The decarbonization pathways were developed by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with technical support from GRESB. They were developed with the oversight of the newly instituted CRREM Scientific Advisory Committee, comprised of carefully selected academic experts with backgrounds in real estate and environmental sustainability across European, North American, and Asian markets. The initiative was funded by APG, PGGM and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and received further support from Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and Ivanhoé Cambridge. It builds on an initial project focusing on the commercial real estate sector in the European Union, which was funded by the European Commission. The Scientific Advisory Committee is comprised of the following members: Dr. Georgia Warren-Myers who is Senior Lecturer in Property at the Melbourne School of Design, Prof. Andy van den Dobbelsteen (PhD MSc) who is Professor of Climate Design & Sustainability at the Delft University of Technology and Dr. Paul Mathew who is a Staff Scientist and Department Head of Whole Building System at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Invitation to provide written feedback CRREM calls on all relevant market participants, including investors, managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), green rating systems and other stakeholders, to share their views on the methodology of the decarbonization pathways and their usefulness in understanding and managing long-term climate-related transition risk in the global real estate sector. We ask that written responses are submitted to [email protected] by June 15th 2020. A summary of consultation responses will be publicly released following the end of the public consultation period.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/real-estate-industry-and-the-covid-19-crisis/,Real estate industry and the Covid-19 crisis,"May 2020 – The Covid-19 pandemic is a human tragedy that is unprecedented in modern times. Beyond claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the world, it has severely disrupted the daily lives of citizens and the functioning of the economy in Europe and across the globe. All countries and economic sectors have been affected. While protecting health and security is paramount, it is also essential to keep vitally important economic sectors functioning during the crisis, making it easier to restart the economy as people are able to return to work. The commercial real estate sector in Europe is a major contributor to these efforts. As a partner to municipalities, local and national governments all across the continent, we have done our utmost to support our communities, tenants, public authorities and health services during the Covid-19 crisis and we stand ready to live up to our significant social and economic responsibility as society re-opens. Real estate, which generally describes the built environment in which we all live and work, plays a vital role in every aspect of the economy, society and environment. Businesses and society are critically dependent on the availability of offices, shops, factories, housing, logistics facilities and many other forms of real estate. The commercial real estate sector delivers and manages the infrastructure needed for entrepreneurship to thrive and places to work. It is, therefore, a fundamental source of employment and economic growth, and a major contributor in addressing two critical challenges of our time: providing liveable and functioning cities for a growing urban population, including offering work and office space for businesses of all sizes, and reducing the environmental footprint of the built environment. Aside from transforming the physical environment in which we lead our daily lives, the real estate sector also directly benefits European citizens, serving as an important catalyst for job creation and feeding so many distinct parts of the economy. The most recent available figures show the commercial real estate industry directly employs 4.0 million people and contributes EUR 385 billion to the European economy annually. Annual investment in new commercial buildings and the refurbishment and development of existing buildings in Europe typically averages around EUR 250-300 billion and represents 10% of total investment in the economy. Investment in housing, other buildings and infrastructure is also substantial, and together with commercial real estate, totals approximately EUR 1.3 trillion annually, which is almost two-thirds of capital investment in the European economy. The capital and expertise that real estate firms can deploy are especially important when society is undergoing rapid change and buildings need to change to remain fit for purpose. The challenges following the pandemic will undoubtedly accelerate the need for such investment over the coming years. Real estate involves the construction, refurbishment and, importantly as technology and society change, repurposing of buildings for different uses. The upkeep, management and care of buildings is also a critical function, undertaken to ensure that buildings are safe and fit for purpose. It is carried out either directly by property owners or on their behalf by a growing number of specialist contractors, many of which are SMEs. These activities are an essential part of maintaining and improving the quality of the accommodation provided to businesses and have not been put on hold during the current crisis even though some tenants are not able to keep up with their lease obligations. Real estate investment also enables the provision of suitable office space, which is especially important for businesses. When new and growing businesses can rent space rather than buy, they gain flexibility and agility in location and employment dynamics required to maximize new opportunities. Renting also frees up available capital, increasing SME’s potential to invest in business expansion and R&D, thereby supporting the European economy, which is a particularly important point as we recover from the current crisis. The effective operation of a rental market for workspace matters enormously in times of flux and heightened uncertainty. Real estate also plays a key role when technological and cultural developments affect the way that our society works. Over the last decade, as shopping has increasingly moved online and away from high streets and shopping centers, owners of commercial real estate have developed the large warehouses that are replacing shops, and started the huge task of repurposing parts of the high street. The Covid- 19 crisis has accelerated these profound changes in the high street, the center of our towns, and the commercial real estate industry will play an important part in post-crisis recovery and town center regeneration, so important to societal morale. Real estate is a long-term business that is capital intensive. Much of that capital investment comes from insurers and pension funds that use it to match their long-term liabilities to provide reliable income and dividends, contributing to the retirement of millions of pensioners and policyholders, while making a major contribution to the development and renewal of the built environment. Private investors also save for their retirement by investing directly in real estate through retail funds or by investing in listed property companies. Another significant part of the capital takes the form of debt provided by Europe’s banks and other lenders, reducing the overall cost of real estate and making the allocation of risk and returns more efficient. Refurbishment and re-development of existing buildings, along with the construction of new buildings, also enable our industry to make an important contribution to the sustainability agenda and energy efficiency, supporting Europe’s green goals. In many cases, this can be done in conjunction with the repurposing of buildings as society’s needs and preferences change, as they no doubt will after the pandemic emergency, and as technology evolves. The European real estate investment industry fully supports and appreciates the measures taken thus far by national governments and the European institutions to soften the financial impact of the crisis on the economy in Europe. Our industry is committed to work with policymakers to explore ways that we can most effectively contribute to support businesses, employees and customers as we take steps together to emerge from the crisis and re-start the economy in Europe. We also believe real estate owners should work together with those who use the space they provide, their lenders and investors, and the many specialist firms that supply them with services, labor and materials to ensure that the costs of this crisis do not fall too heavily on any one set of economic actors. National governments and the European institutions are already working to develop measures designed to support economic stability and recovery. The real estate investment industry would like to recommend five key principles that we believe policymakers should keep in mind to develop measures that will successfully achieve our common goals. Measures should recognize that the real estate that makes up the heart of our towns and cities is inextricably interconnected through its owners to insurance companies, pension funds and the banking system and therefore, ultimately, investments of the greater public and they should support the integrity of that interconnectedness; Measures should create incentives for landlords, lenders, investors and tenants to work together so none is forced to bear the full impact of the current crisis and so all will be in a position to contribute to both economic recovery and European financial and social stability more generally; Measures should be time-limited although recognizing that many businesses will likely take some time to recover; Measures should be implemented quickly, particularly those targeting businesses that have little financial resilience and mounting liabilities; and New measures should complement the measures policymakers have already introduced to support businesses and could be strengthened through improved cross-border investment possibilities in real estate stabilizing national economies across Europe and to facilitate a resilient and sustainable economic recovery."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/worldgbc-and-gresb-join-forces-to-drive-net-zero-carbon-buildings/,WorldGBC and GRESB join forces to drive  net zero carbon buildings,"World Green Building Council, a global network of around 70 Green Building Councils, has announced a collaboration with GRESB, the leading global sustainability benchmark for real estate portfolios, to recognize companies that make a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. 30 April – London, England: World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) and GRESB have announced a collaboration that will see companies who commit to making their portfolios ‘Paris Proof’ by signing WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment (the Commitment) recognized. The Commitment, which recognizes businesses committed to ensuring their portfolio of buildings operate at net zero carbon by 2030, and advocate for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050, is supported by Green Building Councils’ asset level net zero standards in 15 countries and counting, which all adhere to WorldGBC’s global principles for net zero carbon buildings and provide third party assurance of performance. The inclusion of the Commitment by GRESB is hoped to drive uptake of net zero standards across large portfolios in addition to dozens of other Green Building Council rating tools already recognized. Globally, almost 40% of energy-related greenhouse emissions occur from buildings, with 28% coming from the operations of buildings themselves. The Commitment is unique in positioning energy efficiency as a central component to achieving decarbonization across building portfolios, in addition to generating and procuring renewable energy to meet reduced energy demand. This represents the most cost-effective, best practice approach to ensuring buildings are fit for purpose and provide healthy and comfortable environments. At the beginning of this crucial decade of delivery for collective climate action, this collaboration will serve to create investor certainty through: the framework of the Commitment, the annual benchmarking process of GRESB, the value of asset and portfolio decarbonization strategies, and the futureproofing for a net zero economy. Under the new partnership, the two organisations will: explore how the requirements of the Commitment can be addressed through the GRESB Real Estate Assessmentcollaborate on opportunities to share data and knowledge to champion the leadership and ambition being shown by common membersjointly promote and advocate real estate companies to transition their assets and portfolio towards a decarbonized built environmentdevelop a pathway for Green Building Councils’ net zero rating tools and standards to be recognized in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment The GRESB Real Estate Assessment also recognizes where organizations are committed to other environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting protocols, including Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI), Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development. Greater alignment between WorldGBC and GRESB in recognizing responsible market practices from leading organizations is crucial to drive these best practices throughout the wider industry. Local Green Building Councils that form the WorldGBC network facilitate this market transformation through advocacy work with their members and local governments; and by building industry capacity. Cristina Gamboa, CEO, World Green Building Council said: “The Commitment provides a framework for real estate organizations to take action towards net zero carbon portfolios, and new recognition within GRESB Assessments will champion these actions and provide investor confidence in target setting. The next decade is crucial to realize the ambition of the Paris Agreement so now is the time to be seen to act.” Cristina Gamboa, CEO, World Green Building Council said: “The Commitment provides a framework for real estate organizations to take action towards net zero carbon portfolios, and new recognition within GRESB Assessments will champion these actions and provide investor confidence in target setting. The next decade is crucial to realize the ambition of the Paris Agreement so now is the time to be seen to act.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate, GRESB said: “We are excited by this opportunity to work hand in hand with the World Green Building Council to provide greater alignment between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This will in turn support the collective industry effort to transition to net zero emissions and advance sustainable real estate.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate, GRESB said: “We are excited by this opportunity to work hand in hand with the World Green Building Council to provide greater alignment between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This will in turn support the collective industry effort to transition to net zero emissions and advance sustainable real estate.” Sara Neff, Senior Vice President, Sustainability, Kilroy Realty, a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment signatory and GRESB’s 5 year running North American Leader in Sustainability said: “The collaboration between GRESB and WorldGBC will rapidly increase awareness of the importance of climate change commitments, which would both spur adoption of the NZCB Commitment and GBC tools, and accelerate climate action among GRESB respondents.” Sara Neff, Senior Vice President, Sustainability, Kilroy Realty, a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment signatory and GRESB’s 5 year running North American Leader in Sustainability said: “The collaboration between GRESB and WorldGBC will rapidly increase awareness of the importance of climate change commitments, which would both spur adoption of the NZCB Commitment and GBC tools, and accelerate climate action among GRESB respondents.” The full list of the Commitment signatories comprises 48 businesses and organizations including major private sector leaders acknowledging the key role that they must play to tackle the climate crisis. Additionally, governments with 28 cities including London, New York and Tokyo, and six states and regions including California and Scotland have made the Commitment towards net zero carbon buildings by 2050. The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment has the power to radically reduce the building sector’s environmental impact by spearheading a global shift towards aggressive energy efficiency as well as a complete change from fossil fuel-based energy to renewables. Matthew Black, World Green Building Council [email protected] +44 (0) 7415 057 193 Rebecca Moir, World Green Building Council [email protected] Claudia Gonella, GRESB[email protected] The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment comes from Advancing Net Zero, WorldGBC’s global project to accelerate uptake of net zero carbon buildings to 100% by 2050. The project works with the global Green Building Council network to develop tools and resources, including net zero carbon building certification schemes and training programs. The Commitment was launched in September 2018 at the Global Climate Action Summit. It promotes and inspires leadership action on an advanced trajectory from business, governments and NGOs, to scale up responses to net zero carbon buildings through corporate and policy action. See the full profiles of company signatories and what they are committing to here: https://www.worldgbc.org/commitment-signatories A list of all green building certification schemes recognized by GRESB is found in Appendix 5a of the 2020 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide. The World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) is a global network leading the transformation of the built environment, to make it healthier and sustainable. Collectively, with our Green Building Councils (GBCs) in around 70 countries, we accelerate action to deliver on the ambition of the Paris Agreement, by eliminating the buildings and construction sector’s emissions by 2050. We are committed to green buildings for everyone, everywhere to build a better future. Through its global Advancing Net Zero project, WorldGBC is working to help shape a future in which every building in the world is entirely net zero carbon by 2050, eliminating the building and construction sector’s reliance on fossil fuels which are causing irreversible damage to the planet. In order to achieve this goal, the buildings and construction industry must take urgent action to prevent the emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the building lifecycle. Snapshots detail how Green Building Council tools and programs, including net zero carbon building certification schemes, are building industry capacity to deliver high-performance buildings that demonstrate the sector’s potential for decarbonization. www.worldgbc.org Mission-driven and investor-led, GRESB is the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/the-2020-gresb-assessments-are-now-available-in-pre-release/,The 2020 GRESB Assessments are now available in Pre-release,"The 2020 GRESB Assessments are now available in Pre-release. Each year real estate and infrastructure managers use the Assessments to measure, benchmark and improve their sustainability programs and report to their investors on their ESG performance. The attention from investors on ESG performance has never been higher. At last count, more than institutional and financial investors, representing over USD 22 trillion, use GRESB ESG data and tools in their investment decision-making. The 2020 Assessments have been shaped by an extensive engagement with our stakeholders, industry working groups and governance bodies. The changes reflect the evolution of the investment industry as measured by the benchmark, support our efforts to improve data quality and establish the building blocks for improved measurement of real-world performance and impacts over the next few years. Review the 2020 GRESB Assessments The Pre-release materials are available on the Participant Guidance page, together with a step-by-step guide to successfully completing the Assessments when the portal opens on April 1, 2020.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2020-gresb-infrastructure-assessments-development/,2020 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Development,"GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real assets, providing standardized and validated data to capital markets. We were established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to reliable data on the ESG performance of their real estate investments. In 2015, a group of ten founding infrastructure investors came together to establish the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments. In the intervening years, GRESB has grown to become the leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. Our efforts over the last 10 years have focussed on collaborating with the industry to define a common approach to ESG measurement and reporting and building a high-quality data ecosystem to support it. Read our “10 years of GRESB” report for more details. This heritage, plus four years of reporting on GRESB infrastructure, provides a strong foundation for the future. We are now entering a new phase of work where we will place more focus on performance data quality and scoring in the Assessments and benchmarks. The restructuring of our 2020 Assessments into separate Management and Performance Components is an important step in enabling us to support this new phase of work. [wpupg-grid-with-filters id=”2020-infra-pre-release”] Development Process The annual Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and strong participation from our governance groups (described conceptually in the figure below). This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. April – November 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved: Mapping ESG topics and metrics covered by other reporting standards and frameworks relevant to our stakeholders;Identifying areas of potential alignment between those topics and our Assessment; Reviewing and analysing the current responses to all indicators; Reviewing which indicators and metrics were of limited analytical value or of limited interest to investors, and evaluating whether these would be kept or amended. November 2019 – January 2020: Engagement with our governance groups, the Infrastructure Advisory Board and the Infrastructure Benchmark Committee, to discuss the proposed changes and to generate further input into the Assessments. January 2020: Incorporating final comments and publishing the pre-release of the 2020 Fund and Asset Assessments. Mindful of how the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments have developed over the last four years, changes this year are incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and ready to support a greater focus on performance over the next few years. The Fund Assessment has been further aligned to the Asset and Real Estate Assessments. Similar to the Real Estate Assessment, the Asset Assessment has been split into distinct Management and Performance Components. The Management Component has been streamlined with some indicators merged or removed. In addition, the integrated materiality assessment has been refined. The Fund Assessment now consists of a Management Component only, with the scores of the fund’s underlying assets informing the fund’s performance score. The Asset Assessment consists of both a Management and Performance Component. Assets can complete either Component, but will only obtain a GRESB Score if they submit both Components. Overall, the 2020 Assessments provide more consistency between Infrastructure and Real Estate and an improved alignment with other relevant standards and frameworks. The Assessments also lay the groundwork for us to provide new data and analytical tools in the GRESB portal and support a further evolution in data quality. Infrastructure Fund Structural changes The Fund Assessment has been reviewed and further aligned with the Asset Assessment and the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The Fund Assessment will consist of a Management Component, called the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund, which is aligned with the Management Component in the Asset Assessment. The Performance Component of the Fund Assessment will simply comprise the Asset Assessments for the underlying assets. The new Management Component – Infrastructure Fund has been split into five aspects: LeadershipPoliciesReportingRisk ManagementStakeholder Engagement Changes relating to content New indicators have been added in employee engagement, reflecting the importance of these stakeholders to the ESG performance of funds. The new indicators will not be scored in 2020. The indicator on ESG monitoring has been removed since this monitoring is better reflected in the assessments of the underlying assets. For the same alignment reasons, several metrics have been added, changed or removed. Fund score names In order to clarify the use of the various Fund scores, their names have been revised. Funds completing the Management Component will obtain a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Fund. If more than 25% of their underlying assets complete both the Asset Management and Performance Components, the average aggregated GRESB Scores for those assets will provide the Performance Component Score for the Infrastructure Fund. Infrastructure Asset The Assessment has been split into Management and Performance Components, which in turn have been organized into new aspects to better represent the underlying indicators. The result is improved alignment with other reporting standards and frameworks and more consistency between the Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. The Management Component will focus on management and processes and be pitched at the organizational level. The Performance Component will focus on measuring performance and be pitched at the asset level. The Management Component is suitable for any type of infrastructure company, asset and investment strategy. It is validated, scored and peer-benchmarked using the globally recognized GRESB methodology, and can be completed individually or in combination with the Performance Component. Each Component determines an individual score, but only entities that submit both Components will receive a GRESB Score and GRESB Rating. Materiality approach refined The integrated materiality assessment is a fundamental element of the Asset Assessment and tailors each Assessment to the particular characteristics of the participating asset. A thorough review of the materiality approach resulted in new ESG issues, materiality factors and sectors being added, and weightings being refined for certain ESG issues. Importantly, the materiality threshold has been lifted from ‘No relevanceʼ to ‘Low relevanceʼ so that issues deemed of ‘No relevanceʼ or ‘Low relevanceʼ will no longer be scored (previously ‘Low relevance issues were scored). This reduces the number of indicators that need to be addressed by participants and lowers the reporting burden. Reporting boundaries The description of reporting boundaries has been clarified by providing checklists of ancillary activities, allowing for exceptions for particular indicators to be more easily reported. These descriptions are essential to allow reporting boundaries to be further standardized in the future, thereby facilitating benchmarks based on fair comparisons. Validation The validation process has been reviewed and improved in 2020. There will be a heavier focus on automatic validation of all indicators using rules and (for the first time in the Infrastructure Assessment) outlier checks. Manual validation will focus on the most relevant indicators and remove the need for evidence upload for less important indicators. The indicators and evidence that will be manually validated will be defined and consistently applied from year to year. Asset score names Assets completing the Management Component – Infrastructure Asset will receive a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Asset. They will only obtain an overall GRESB Score – Infrastructure Asset if they also complete the Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset. Scoring changes Participants will have the flexibility to complete either or both Management and Performance Components. New participants might start with the Management Component only, as a simple assessment with low reporting burden. This will assist with growing participation, for example in emerging markets. Some participants may only want to complete the Performance Component, to use the assessment for reporting their performance data only. Importantly, the premier measurement of ESG performance for investors will remain the full GRESB Assessment (i.e. Management plus Performance Components). This will be emphasized in our communications to prevent any intentional or accidental greenwashing. In the GRESB Model, the Management Component score will replace the Management & Policy (MP) score and the Performance Component score will replace the Implementation & Measurement (IM) score. The Management Component – Infrastructure Asset has been restructured into five aspects. The new aspects align with the Real Estate Assessment and external sustainability frameworks where practical. The new aspects have been mapped to the 2019 indicators and aspects, enabling comparisons over time; LeadershipPoliciesReportingRisk ManagementStakeholder Engagement Changes relating to content Several indicators were amended, from slight name changes, added or removed metrics, to changes to the structure of indicators. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset comprises the 2019 aspects on Performance Indicators and Certifications & Awards, as well as the 2019 indicators on employee training (formerly MA7) and implementation of actions (formerly RO4). The Component has been restructured in alignment with the 2020 Real Estate Assessment into twelve aspects: ImplementationOutput & ImpactHealth & SafetyEnergyGreenhouse Gas EmissionsAir PollutionWaterWasteBiodiversity & HabitatEmployeesCustomersCertifications & Awards Materiality approach refined With the lifting of the materiality threshold, the number of indicators that need to be addressed in the Performance Component will be reduced for most participants. This should mean a significant reduction in reporting burden. Indicators that are not material may still be reported on, on a purely optional basis. Reporting on implementation of actions (formerly RO4) has been split into separate Environmental, Social and Governance indicators for more structured communication of the implementation of measures and actions. The indicators on customer and employee satisfaction programs (formerly PI9.1 and PI10.1) have been removed since these actions can be reported under implementation. All metrics have been reviewed against external standards and frameworks such as CDP, DJSI and GRI. As a result, several metrics have been renamed, modified or removed for better alignment. Questions have been added on the external review of quantitative data to enable us to further improve data quality. The new questions will be unscored. Assessment Pre-Release The Assessment Pre-Release is now available: 2020 Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-Release2020 Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-Release While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2020 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2020 Infrastructure Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications. The Resilience Module will run for the third year and will continue being offered as an optional supplement to both the Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments. The Module is scored separately and does not influence other scores. The road ahead Looking ahead, we will continue to work with our governance groups and industry stakeholders to further develop the Assessments, benchmark methodology and the resulting analytics. Changing emphasis from Management to Performance Over the coming years, the emphasis of the Assessments will shift to having a greater focus on performance. This will be achieved through four main mechanisms: These changes will take place progressively and be clearly flagged in advance to give time for the industry to understand and adjust to expectations. Simultaneously, we will use the performance metrics to enable reporting of impacts in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Reducing reporting burden We will continue to make further improvements to reduce the reporting burden, including: Continuing to improve alignment with the most relevant industry reporting frameworks such as PRI, CDP, DJSI (RobecoSAM), GRI, SASB and IFC. GRESB has built relationships with these organizations and will continue to explore opportunities for further streamlining of our assessments.Automating data transfer from the participant side through greater use of spreadsheets and data APIs. Whilst this requires some investment from GRESB, data partners and participants in the short term, it will ultimately streamline the processing of data and reporting inputs, requiring far less human intervention and ultimately reducing both resource requirements and the risk of errors. Increasing transparency Transparency is one of GRESB’s core values. We have had considerable feedback on the need for greater transparency of our own practices and we have responded by publishing our entire Assessment methodology and scoring documentation. We will continue to provide even greater transparency to assist participants to better understand our requirements and processes and thereby enable them to report more accurately and get more direct and immediate feedback on their ESG performance. Changes will include: Providing the scoring details upfront with the Assessment Reference Guides and in the Portal.In the longer term, providing draft scoring within the Portal so that participants can see their draft (unvalidated) score ‘as they go’, thus providing immediate feedback and enabling them to ask ‘what-if’ questions.Providing details of the validation decisions in the benchmark report including what was validated at what level and why.Providing immediate feedback on calculated variables derived from assessment inputs such as intensity metrics. In this way, participants will be immediately aware of their performance and can use this to start thinking about how to improve their performance immediately, rather than waiting until the results are released. This also provides a check for them on their inputs, since these calculated variables should be more comparable to their peers than their raw absolute metric inputs. More flexible outputs Consistent with developments in the world of ‘big data’, GRESB investor members are seeking to use their data in more varied and flexible ways. We will provide both tailored solutions around specific products and greater flexibility for advanced users in the future. These outputs will be developed through close engagement with investors to include: Customized impact analyses and peer group comparisonsEnhanced portfolio analysis including footprinting based on aggregated asset dataTailored reports on portfolios aligned with key reporting frameworks More insight on participant performance To provide more insights on participant performance GRESB will: Standardize the metrics to ensure that all participants within each sector are reporting comparable data. This includes developing standards for boundaries and assumptions and ensuring that data is accurate at asset level.Improve data cleaning mechanisms such as outlier checks and pre-validation to minimize participant entry errors.Add new indicators where needed to address emerging material issues, such as:Carbon footprinting and net zero carbonData availability and qualitySocial impactSocial licence (using external, rather than self-reported data)Supply chain (including Modern Slavery)Digitalization For more information about the future development of the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments and our priorities to achieve our shared vision of sustainable real assets, click here."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/asset-level-reporting-fundamental-for-evaluating-real-estate-performance/,Asset-level reporting: fundamental for evaluating Real Estate Performance,"Since its establishment 10 years ago, GRESB has been at the heart of a collaborative effort to build consensus on what constitutes ESG materiality in the real estate sector, define standardized metrics, and develop a consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance. It’s a communal effort and we are grateful to be supported by a powerful global ecosystem of investors, lenders, managers, service providers and industry bodies working to improve ESG transparency across the world. We are now entering a new phase of industry development where greater ESG transparency must be a means to improve the ESG performance of the underlying assets in real estate portfolios. Where real progress towards improving operational performance is the priority, not transparency for its own sake. This shift comes in response to changing demand from the investor community, who increasingly expect managers to be able to monitor their assets directly, on the basis of real, reliable ESG performance data. This higher-resolution data will enable us to provide more granular and reliable ESG data and benchmarks, unlock a new generation of performance insights from asset-level up, and support a systematic tracking of industry progress against sector-specific targets, as well as local and global goals. Asset-level reporting will facilitate the next evolution in data accessibility and reliability in the GRESB Assessments and Benchmarks. We are introducing a new asset-level validation process and implementing more automated error and outlier checks. The algorithms are iterative and will “learn” from the feedback provided by our participants on an on-going basis. The result will provide access to consolidated ESG performance at the portfolio level that is underscored by improved data quality at the asset level. More data does not have to mean a higher reporting burden. We host an increasing number of API connections with GRESB Data Partners and are continuously investing in state-of-the-art tools to facilitate new levels of data sharing and a more seamless reporting experience. With ESG data becoming increasingly relevant in investment decision making, index products, loans, bonds and commercial agreements, it is our responsibility to ensure a fair and robust benchmarking process, eliminating blind spots and creating comparable performance baselines that the industry can rely on. As the reported data becomes more granular, we gain exponential visibility into how the assets operate and can provide a more rigorous analysis of ESG performance. Having asset-level data as the baseline for analysis will open up a deeper understanding of exposure to environmental risks and help to uncover the sources of improvements in a portfolio as well as the links to future portfolio performance. It will also enable consistent calculations of intensities and performance against targets, without the issue of embedded methodological differences. In addition, overlaying fundamentals, such as building location and age, will enable a deeper and more sophisticated analysis of portfolio resilience and performance. As part of this work, we are upgrading the Asset Portal to enable managers to assess the exposure of their assets to specific ESG risks. These new services are based on integrating geo-coded asset data with third-party geospatial risk datasets and will be accessible entirely at the discretion of managers. Our 2019 collaboration with Verisk Maplecroft on the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard, which focuses on physical climate risk data, is an early example of this approach. Going forward, these integrations will be available directly in the Portal, and will expand to include financial and other third-party datasets. Asset-level data can be aggregated to the city, country, region and global level, enabling a bottom-up, systematic understanding of what needs to be done to address the sustainability challenge. It enables an analysis of the bigger picture, the aggregate story, about how well the industry is progressing against key goals and global targets such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) Net Zero targets, as well as other more local targets and sector-specific goals. The 2020 GRESB Real Estate Assessment will include an integration with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology to show real estate carbon transition pathways at both asset and portfolio level to remain within 1.5 and 2.0 degrees of warming. These pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the retrofit investments required to transition to a low carbon economy. For further information, see the Pre-release of the 2020 Real Estate Assessment and the 2020 Real Estate Assessment development process."

With this foundation in place, we are now entering a new phase of work where we will focus further on performance data accessibility and reliability in the Assessments and benchmarks. The restructuring of our 2020 Assessments into separate Management and Performance Components is an important step in enabling us to support this new phase of work. The annual Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and strong participation from our governance groups. This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. 2020 Assessments Structure An important outcome of the 2020 Assessment development process has been a reconfirmation that the Assessments address material ESG topics for the real estate and infrastructure industry. As a result, the 2020 development process was limited to making structural changes to the Assessments rather than introducing new indicators or making extensive content changes with an impact on scoring. The structural changes arise from the introduction of the separate Management, Performance and Development Components. On the content side, the number of indicators in the Assessments has been reduced and several indicators have been simplified. This is particularly apparent in the Performance Component, where the introduction of asset-level reporting has allowed the removal of several indicators measuring data availability and coverage. With the introduction of the GRESB Development Benchmark, participants with development activities will have a better understanding of their ESG performance and how this compares to their peers. Previously, this benchmark only included developers, but now managers with both standing investments and development projects will be included in both the GRESB Developer Benchmark and GRESB Real Estate Benchmark and will receive two Benchmark Reports to reflect their performance in each category. Overall, the 2020 Assessments provide more consistency between real estate and infrastructure and an improved alignment with other responding standards and frameworks. The Assessments also lay the groundwork for us to provide new data and analytical tools in the Portal and support a further evolution in data quality. The starting point for the Assessment development process was the 2019 Assessments. The 2019 indicators have been allocated to the new Management, Performance and Development components, on the basis that: The Management Component measures the entity’s strategy and leadership management, policies and processes, risk management and stakeholder engagement approaches, comprising of information collected at the organizational level. The Performance Component measures the entity’s asset portfolio performance, comprising of information collected at the asset and at the portfolio level. It is suitable for any real estate company or fund with operational assets. The Development Component measures the entity’s efforts to address ESG issues during the design, construction, and renovation of buildings. This component is suitable for entities involved innew construction (building design, site selection and/or construction) and/or major renovation projects, with on-going projects or completed projects during the reporting period. Management Component Development process: April – September 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved mapping ESG topics covered by other frameworks relevant to our stakeholders and identifying areas of potential alignment and improvement in our Assessments. This allows us to work towards market convergence on the main ESG topics, increase reporting efficiencies and ensure our Assessments continue to reflect the most commonly used indicators and metrics. Based on this exercise, we extended the scope of our indicators to capture data and information that was not previously tracked. We performed a detailed alignment exercise between the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure AssessmentsWe identified indicators and sections that could/should be removed because:They have little or no analytical valueThey have reached a maturity level that makes them redundant for an ESG benchmarkWe aligned the aspects for Real Estate and Infrastructure and connected them better with the new set of indicators They have little or no analytical valueThey have reached a maturity level that makes them redundant for an ESG benchmark Key outcomes: Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees, the Management Component does not introduce new topics or scored indicators. The developments are largely structural and are limited to: Restructuring into five aspects: Leadership, Policies, Reporting, Risk management, Stakeholder engagement New answer options to strengthen alignment across all AssessmentsNew answer options to strengthen alignment with other external frameworks (e.g. PRI, RobecoSAM, CDP, etc.)All indicators are formulated at the entity level (i.e. “Does the entity…..”?)Each indicator is assigned a title, to facilitate easy referencing in various documents and data download tools Performance Component Development process: April – December 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments with a few primary changes in mind: Adapting all Performance Indicators and Building Certifications indicators for required asset level reportingImproving data quality of the reported data by increasing the simplicity of the reporting structure and improving data granularity to enable better data checks by the GRESB Portal, participant users, and validatorsImproving data standardization by ensuring that data can be reported using the same format for multiple years, facilitating easier data exchange between systems. Additionally, enhanced energy data granularity enables the calculation of comparable GHG data Key outcomes: Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees and Advisory Board, the Performance Component includes a combination of portfolio-level and asset-level indicators. The scope of the Component is reduced and enables performance measurement at the asset level: No new indicators were introducedRestructured into 10 aspects:Portfolio-level aspects: Risks Assessment, Data Review, Targets, Tenants and CommunityAsset-level aspects: Energy, GHG Emissions, Water, Waste, Efficiency Measures, Building CertificationsMandatory asset level reporting for all aspects/indicators marked “Asset level”The concept of ”managed/indirectly managed assets” replaced by a distinction between landlord controlled and tenant controlled areas, in line with other industry frameworksReduced complexity and reporting burden through the removal of several indicators:ME2: Data management systemsME3, ME 4, ME 5: Energy consumption, Water consumption, Waste management monitoring methodsPI1.2, PI2.2, PI3.2: Energy, GHG emissions, Water use intensity ratesRO4, RO5, RO6, RO7: Technical building assessments and implementation of energy, water, waste efficiency measures are simplified and measured at asset levelGRESB will introduce new Energy and Water use intensity calculations, using information reported at the asset level. The methodology will evolve over time, in collaboration with our governance groups and will not be used for scoring in 2020.Standardized reporting of Scope 2 GHG emissions data using a location-based approach. In addition, participants can also report the market-based calculated values on a voluntary basis. Portfolio-level aspects: Risks Assessment, Data Review, Targets, Tenants and CommunityAsset-level aspects: Energy, GHG Emissions, Water, Waste, Efficiency Measures, Building Certifications ME2: Data management systemsME3, ME 4, ME 5: Energy consumption, Water consumption, Waste management monitoring methodsPI1.2, PI2.2, PI3.2: Energy, GHG emissions, Water use intensity ratesRO4, RO5, RO6, RO7: Technical building assessments and implementation of energy, water, waste efficiency measures are simplified and measured at asset level Development Component Development process: November 2018 – November 2019: The Assessment development process began at the end of 2018, with a survey of all 300+ GRESB participants with new construction and major renovations activities (either as part of pure developer portfolios, or as part of mixed portfolios with both standing investments and development projects). We received 91 responses, representing approx. 150 entities. Key feedback from the survey included: Participating entities need separate scores for standing investment and development projectsInvolvement in NC&MR should not impact peer group allocationNC&MR share similar material ESG issues and should continue being analysed together. Further segmentation would make results difficult to compareBuilding certifications is a critical topic for new developments We incorporated this feedback into our 2020 Assessment proposal in discussions with the Benchmark Committees. Key outcomes: The introduction of the GRESB Development Benchmark which will include both pure developers who previously completed the Developer Assessment, and managers who have both standing investments and development projects. Standing investments will be captured in the Performance Components and development projects in the Development Component With the combination of both the Management Component and Development Component, 400+ entities will now be able to understand and benchmark their ESG performance of development activities. In 2019, 41 entities participated in the Developer Assessment and these entities made up the 2019 Developer Benchmark. 379 Real Estate entities also engaged in development activities in 2019, but their NC&MR aspect score was not included in the benchmarkPeer grouping will follow the Real Estate methodology, using property type of development projects, region and portfolio nature of ownership (i.e. listed, non-listed, etc.)Building certifications will continue to be an important aspect of the Development Component and subject-specific indicators are aligned with building certification best practices. Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees, the Development Component has seen largely a structural change with the introduction of aspects. These aspects include both policy/strategy indicators specifically relating to development activities, as well as the performance-related indicators: Restructured into seven aspects: ESG Requirements, Materials, Building Certifications, Energy, Water, Waste, and Stakeholder EngagementIntroduced new topics specific to development activities, through indicators on life-cycle assessments, disclosure of embodied carbon, and community engagement New answer options to strengthen alignment across all assessments and other external frameworks (e.g. PRI, RobecoSAM, CDP, etc.)New answer options based on commonly provided, accepted other answers The 2020 Management, Performance (including the Asset Level Spreadsheet) and Development components are available in pre-release versions here. While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2020 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2020 Real Estate Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications. 2020 GRESB Results The GRESB Real Estate Benchmark will consist of participants completing both the Management and Performance Components. The GRESB Development Benchmark will consist of participants completing both the Management and Development Components. While each Component determines an individual score (ie: Management Component Score, Performance Component Score, Development Component Score), the GRESB Scores and GRESB Ratings will only apply to entities completing all relevant Components for their portfolios. The possible combinations are set out below and illustrated in the diagram that follows: A: Portfolios with only standing investments submit: Management and Performance Components to receive a GRESB Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Performance Component Score B: Portfolios with only development projects submit: Management and Development Components to receive a GRESB Development Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Development Component Score C: Portfolios with both standing investments and development projects submit: Management, Performance and Development Components to receive two Benchmark Reports:Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating; andDevelopment Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Performance Component ScoreGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Development Component Score Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating; andDevelopment Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating The Resilience Module will run its third iteration and will continue being offered as an optional supplement to any Component of the Real Estate Assessment. The Module is scored separately and does not influence other scores. The Assessment reporting period remains the same as in previous years: 1 April – 1 July, 2020. Scoring implications The scoring implications of the restructured Assessment are set out below. The analysis uses the 2019 Real Estate Assessment results as baseline. 2020 The 2019 indicators have been allocated to the new Management, Performance and Development Components. As such, some indicators formerly classified under dimension IM (Implementation & Measurement) were moved to Management, while some others were either removed or no longer scored. The weights of the Assessment components (Management, Performance and Development) are set out below: Standing investments: GRESB Score = 30% Management Component Score + 70% Performance Component Score Development projects:GRESB Score = 30% Management Component Score + 70% Development Component Score The Management + Performance; Management + Development Components define the GRESB Standing Investments and Development models, respectively. The Component weights are fixed and apply to the Component scores expressed in percentages. The adjustment to a 30/70 split means that the 2020 GRESB Score will be weighted more towards Performance than in 2019. Additionally, as the weights determine the length of the axes in the GRESB model, there will be an impact on the quintile lines and the GRESB Rating in each benchmark. The results of this preliminary analysis against the 2019 baseline indicate that the impact on the GRESB Score is limited, but participants can expect an average decrease of a few points, in the Performance Score, assuming a “do nothing” scenario. This is consistent in both the Standing Investments and Development Benchmark. The evolution of scores is attributed to an increased weight to development activities and less weight on the policy/strategy of the Management Component. Overall, the evolution of scores is in line with our transition to a more performance-based Assessment that reflects the activity to improve the performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio. The road ahead Looking ahead, we will continue to work with our governance groups and industry stakeholders to further develop the Assessments, the benchmark methodology and the resulting analytics. Key priorities include: Developing models for normalizing energy and water use intensities at the asset-level accounting for material factors such as vacancy rate, degree/cooling days, property type, etc.Further refining our scoring model to start benchmarking asset-level intensities for all property-types (reflecting “true performance”) against comparable assets within their region.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/reflecting-on-the-last-10-years-of-gresb-and-preparing-for-whats-ahead/,Reflecting on the last 10 years of GRESB and preparing for what’s ahead,"Mainstreaming ESG benchmarking in real assets 10 years ago, APG, PGGM and USS came together with the University of Maastricht to design a real estate survey. They wanted more transparency on the ESG performance of their real estate investments and a closer engagement with their managers. The inaugural Real Estate Assessment was launched in 2009, and GRESB was born. In the years that followed, an entire industry has come together to develop a common language and consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance. Today, more than 100 investors, representing over USD 22 trillion AUM, encourage their managers to report to GRESB, and the resulting Real Estate and Infrastructure Benchmarks cover more than USD 4.5 trillion in real asset value. The reason why we established GRESB is simple. Ten years ago there was no uniform or consistent way to measure the sustainability performance of real estate companies and funds across countries, across regions and across private and publicly traded investment structures. And if you can’t measure and compare, it is difficult to engage with a manager on how to improve.” Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets at APG Asset Management The reason why we established GRESB is simple. Ten years ago there was no uniform or consistent way to measure the sustainability performance of real estate companies and funds across countries, across regions and across private and publicly traded investment structures. And if you can’t measure and compare, it is difficult to engage with a manager on how to improve.” This process of annual ESG benchmarking on such a large scale has built a powerful global ecosystem of investors, lenders, managers, service providers and industry bodies working towards a shared vision of sustainable real assets. It’s a story that demonstrates how a top-down demand for ESG transparency and benchmarking encourages a bottom-up response that drives the spread of sustainability best practices around the world, raising the standard of an entire industry. Standardized benchmarks work because they give clarity and direction to the market and a means to focus on complex problems. They help capital providers and asset managers compare investments across portfolios, inspiring a deeper engagement on the opportunities, risks and choices that need to be made as the industry transitions to a sustainable future. And at an aggregated level, benchmarks provide an objective reference point on sector and regional performance, help to track industry progress against relevant targets and shine a light on where to focus improvement efforts. Having the asset owner as the driving force behind the GRESB Assessments, and engaged in their development from the beginning, has been key to the rapid growth of the benchmark. This investor pressure is driving transformative change through the investment chain and raising the sustainability standard of an entire industry.” David Russell, Head of Responsible Investment at USS. Having the asset owner as the driving force behind the GRESB Assessments, and engaged in their development from the beginning, has been key to the rapid growth of the benchmark. This investor pressure is driving transformative change through the investment chain and raising the sustainability standard of an entire industry.” The report “10 years of GRESB” celebrates the key milestones in our development over the past decade and includes commentary from a group of sustainability champions from across the world who have inspired us with their leadership and commitment. Our industry is full of such people who have contributed so much to our collective vision and the growth of the benchmark. This momentum in the right direction is vital and should be celebrated, but it does not take away the urgency of the challenges that lie ahead. In the next decade we will need to take dramatic steps as an industry if we are to achieve sustainable real assets. Preeminent among the challenges is climate risk and resilience. Central banks have already made the link between climate risk and financial stability, calls for mandatory climate related disclosures are intensifying and it’s clear that the longer the industry delays in addressing risks associated with climate change the more disruptive the policy response will inevitably be. At the same time, it’s not enough to just focus on climate action. We are facing multiple convergent crises to which a sustainable real asset industry can make an important contribution – ecological system breakdown, mass extinctions, growing inequality, political instability, mass migrations, demographic changes and accelerated urbanization – and significant improvement in one area can only be delivered together with measures to increase progress in all areas. The stakes are getting higher for the industry and our success in the next decade will not only be measured by the coverage of our benchmarks, but by our ability to influence investment practices that lead to more sustainable and resilient real assets. We have listened to the feedback of our members, partners, governance bodies, and working groups, and engaged with the broader industry that relies on our benchmarks and standards and identified a set of priorities and commitments to guide the next phase of our work. These align with our three strategic pillars: Assessments, Technology and Stakeholders. The last 10 years have shown the power of an industry-led benchmark to inspire a collaborative effort to improve ESG transparency across the world. We are proud of the role our members have played in shaping the Assessments and Benchmarks and are committed to finding ways to further integrate their collective intelligence into our work. This starts in 2020, when we will recognize all participants as GRESB Members, opening up new opportunities to be involved in our working groups, committees and governance bodies. Transparency is one of our core values and we are taking steps to improve our Assessment guidance and support so that participants are able to report more accurately and efficiently. Future improvements include providing immediate feedback on calculated variables derived from Assessment inputs, more detailed scoring information and, ultimately, draft scoring within the Portal as well as greater clarity on validation decisions, and their rationale, in the Benchmark Reports. Over time we will add an additional layer of transparency in both the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessment showing where managers are on the journey of including all of their assets in the benchmark. In 2020 we will introduce a new Review Period in the Assessment Cycle to further strengthen the reliability of our Assessments and Benchmark results. The Review Period will start on September 1, when preliminary individual GRESB results will be made available to all participants. During the Review Period, participants will be able to submit a review request to GRESB using a dedicated form. The final results will be launched to both participants and Investor Members on October 1. Public Results events and other results outputs will be rescheduled to October and November in order to accommodate the September Review Period. GRESB has been approached by several institutional investors and asset managers to develop a global ESG benchmark and assessment framework for assessing investments in agriculture, forestry and other real asset verticals. A first step will be to convene an Industry Working Group to discuss the development of the new Assessments. We are also exploring applying our benchmarking methodology and industry-led approach to other asset classes such as private equity or private markets more broadly. Two additional areas we are investigating are government-owned infrastructure and corporate real estate. The investment industry is sharpening its focus on transition and physical risks associated with climate change. Starting in 2020, we are introducing new tools for investors and managers to inform their engagement on these risks and support strategic decision making. The 2020 Real Estate Assessment will include an integration with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology to show real estate carbon transition pathways at portfolio and asset level to remain within 1.5 and 2.0 degrees of warming. The pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the investments required to transition to a low-carbon economy. GRESB has an important role to play in helping the investment community understand climate-change risks in real asset investments. The CRREM science-based decarbonization targets and pathways can be used to inform our engagement with external investment managers in order to reduce transition risks.” Mathieu Elshout, Senior Director Private Real Estate at PGGM GRESB has an important role to play in helping the investment community understand climate-change risks in real asset investments. The CRREM science-based decarbonization targets and pathways can be used to inform our engagement with external investment managers in order to reduce transition risks.” In parallel, we are upgrading the Real Estate Asset Portal to enable managers to assess the exposure of their assets to physical climate risks. These new services, which are based on integrating geo-coded asset data with third party geospatial risk datasets, will be accessible entirely at the discretion of managers. Our 2019 collaboration with Verisk Maplecroft on a Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard for real estate portfolios, which focuses on physical risk data, is an early example of this approach. Going forward, these integrations will be available directly in the Portal, and will expand to include financial metrics and other third-party datasets. Over time, we envisage introducing an even higher weighting of the Performance Component towards the GRESB Score. The Performance Indicator metrics in the Assessments will be standardized to provide better comparisons and more transparency on actual performance. These changes will be flagged in advance, to give time for the industry to understand and adjust to expectations. With a growing number of our Investor Members interested in understanding their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their investments’ ESG impacts and outcomes in general, we are taking steps to ensure our Assessments are aligned with new taxonomies that are being developed. Other important national and global frameworks and targets that investors and managers are seeking to align with include the World Green Building Council’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, the TCFD recommendations, the Paris Climate Agreement, Science Based Targets initiative, EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy and Disclosure Regulations and the International Energy Agency Sustainable Development Scenario. We are committed to supporting these efforts by refining the performance metrics to enable reporting of impacts and outcomes, aligned with these frameworks. Several factors are now converging to facilitate a further evolution in performance data accessibility and reliability in the Assessments and Benchmarks. First, requirements for asset-level reporting in the Performance Component of the Real Estate Assessment will enable us to introduce a new asset-level validation process. Second, we are leveraging advanced technology to put in place more automated error and outlier checks. Third, the expanding API integrations with GRESB data partners are resulting in a more streamlined and robust asset-level performance data reporting process. And fourth, we are moving forward as an industry to define common guidelines for performance data reporting as reflected in the GRESB ESG Data Standard. The sum of these efforts is creating a high-quality ESG performance data flow and global database, from asset-level up, that investors and managers can rely on to better understand risks and opportunities and take appropriate actions. Consistent with developments in the world of ‘big data’, our members are seeking to use their data in more flexible ways. We will provide both tailored solutions around specific products, and greater flexibility for advanced users in the future. These outputs will be developed through close engagement with investors and managers to include customized impact analyses and peer group comparisons; enhanced access to raw data for modeling and time-series analyses through a re-designed data export tool; as well as enhanced portfolio analysis tools, including footprinting based on aggregated asset data. With the 2020 restructuring of the Assessments into separate Management and Performance Components (and Development Component for real estate developers), managers will be able to complete one of the Components and still be part of the benchmark. For example, managers with more opportunistic strategies and those who are constructing a portfolio or raising capital will find value in the Management Component as a way to share structured ESG information with investors. The Management Component will also provide an easier entry point to new participants for whom the reporting burden can be particularly challenging, such as those in emerging markets. While the restructuring will open up the Assessment to new participants, the GRESB Score will only apply to: Real Estate entities completing both the Management and Performance (or the Management and Development Components in the case of developers)Infrastructure Funds participating with at least 25% of their assets in the Infrastructure Asset AssessmentInfrastructure Assets completing both the Management and Performance Components The GRESB Score will continue to underpin the GRESB Ratings and drive the global Benchmarks, just as it does today. Reducing the reporting burden for Assessment participants is not a new imperative for GRESB, but it’s one that requires continued focus. The sheer scale of the transition we are going through as an industry requires an ESG reporting process that is as straightforward and efficient as possible. We are introducing new tools within the Portal to increase reporting efficiencies, improving our alignment with other reporting initiatives and strengthening our capacity in those non-OECD markets where our coverage is still relatively low. In addition, we are building a new online Assessment training program alongside our in-person training to make the content more accessible to managers and partners around the world. We’re in the process of designing a new collaborative research agenda with our members, partners and industry partners. Our extensive ESG coverage of the industry means we are in a unique position to provide deep insights back to the market on the evolving state of sustainability in real assets. Building on initiatives already underway, our 2020 research efforts will focus on providing deeper insights into transition and physical risks associated with climate change. There is also the opportunity to develop a new suite of aggregated benchmarks by sector, region and country relevant for our industry partners, their membership and networks. As an organization with fewer than 30 employees and a relatively small operational footprint, our most significant impacts come from our assessment and benchmarking work and, ultimately, the extent to which we are able to influence investment practices that lead to more sustainable real assets. At the same time, we are committed to managing the impacts from our operations, being transparent about our own performance and taking action to further improve it in the future. We have reported on our operational performance in 10 Years of GRESB. Reflecting our material impacts, we focussed our social reporting on employees and our environmental reporting on our operational GHG emissions. We have taken the step to offset our GHG emissions from staff flights, office energy consumption and staff lunches, estimated for the decade where data is available, by planting two GRESB Forests via the Treedom program. One forest of 802 trees will be located in Kenya. The second forest, in Guatemala, will have 250 trees. Looking forward, we have made a commitment to improving the sustainability of GRESB events and will continue to measure the key indicators highlighted in this report as well as engage more closely with our stakeholders on how best to communicate our impacts and reduce these further in the future. As we look back over what has been a remarkable decade for ESG benchmarking, we are reminded that we are only here today because of the global community that has developed around our shared mission. As investors, lenders, managers, operators, leaders, influencers and experts, you are the ones digging in to ask and answer the tough sustainability questions. You are the ones managing the risks, identifying the opportunities and finding ways to make positive real-world impacts. It’s your efforts that are making the difference. Your decisions that are re-shaping the markets. And your investments that are shaping the future that we and next generations will inherit. The transition to a sustainable real asset industry is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. We can only meet it with reliable ESG information, meaningful global benchmarks and collective action from all our stakeholders as we work towards a more sustainable future.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-verisk-maplecroft-launch-the-climate-risk-resilience-scorecard/,GRESB and Verisk Maplecroft Launch the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard,"Amsterdam and London, November 12, 2019 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets and Verisk Maplecroft, the leading provider of global ESG, climate and political risk analytics, have jointly launched the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard. Combining Verisk Maplecroft’s global risk analytics with GRESB’s geo-coded asset-data and adaptation measures, the scorecard provides location-specific intelligence on climate change and ESG exposure to create a unique risk-adjusted and asset-level benchmark of global real estate investment. GRESB participants will be able to access powerful new insights into their risk exposure, the competitiveness of their climate and ESG management and resilience, and the global assets they should focus their attention on. It also provides a means of concisely communicating climate-related, ESG and resilience performance, and underlying risk context, to investors. By identifying location-specific climate and ESG risk exposure and management, the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard builds on the results of GRESB’s Real Estate Assessment. The methodology has been developed to evaluate how well real estate funds, companies and direct real estate investors manage risks related to climate change, ESG and natural hazards once their underlying risk exposures are taken into account. For the first time, firms managing global real estate assets will be able to understand their exposure, from asset-level up, to a host of climate and ESG factors and what it means for their resilience and ESG management competitiveness”, said Verisk Maplecroft’s Head of Financial Sector Risk James Lockhart Smith. “The needs and expectations of real estate investors are developing rapidly in response to mounting pressures, especially in relation to climate, and we are delighted to be working with GRESB to fill this critical gap in the data landscape.” For the first time, firms managing global real estate assets will be able to understand their exposure, from asset-level up, to a host of climate and ESG factors and what it means for their resilience and ESG management competitiveness”, said Verisk Maplecroft’s Head of Financial Sector Risk James Lockhart Smith. “The needs and expectations of real estate investors are developing rapidly in response to mounting pressures, especially in relation to climate, and we are delighted to be working with GRESB to fill this critical gap in the data landscape.” Creating the new Climate Risk and Resilience Scorecard with Verisk Maplecroft is a significant step towards providing a new set of valuable insights from data already reported to GRESB,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The Scorecard enables managers to demonstrate to investors that they are managing ESG and climate risks and will help with climate-related disclosure requirements, such as the TCFD recommendations.” Creating the new Climate Risk and Resilience Scorecard with Verisk Maplecroft is a significant step towards providing a new set of valuable insights from data already reported to GRESB,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The Scorecard enables managers to demonstrate to investors that they are managing ESG and climate risks and will help with climate-related disclosure requirements, such as the TCFD recommendations.” Learn more about the Scorecard.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/investors-fund-new-initiative-to-assess-climate-change-transition-risk-in-global-real-estate-investment-portfolios/,Investors fund new initiative to assess climate change transition risk in global real estate investment portfolios,"Amsterdam, September 16, 2019 – An investor-led initiative launched today will help real estate investors and managers to assess, manage and mitigate climate risk and to develop climate scenario-based strategies. The research will be carried out by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with the support of GRESB, the ESG Benchmark for Real Assets, and funded by APG, PGGM and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). The future implementation of carbon regulations consistent with the goal of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less is one of several plausible scenarios for future climate transition risk. The initiative will develop 1.5 and 2-degree decarbonization pathways for real estate assets by applying global carbon budgets as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Each pathway will extend to 2050 and be comprised of annual estimates of building-related carbon emissions and energy performance – expressed in kWh per m2/ft2 and CO2 per m2/ft2 respectively – aligned with the global warming goals as set out in the Paris agreement. The initiative builds on the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM)* project, funded by the European Commission, which analyzed carbon risk in the European commercial real estate sector earlier this year. This initiative will expand the CRREM project to include major real estate markets outside the EU, and the residential sector. The decarbonization pathways developed for each market and sector can be used as a proxy measure for transition risk and help the real estate industry meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). “Decarbonization pathways based on a transparent methodology that is aligned with the Paris Agreement offer a tool for understanding and managing transition risks, enabling investors to benchmark assets and derive significant risk indicators. The positive industry feedback in the CRREM project confirms this conviction and it seems to be the logical next step to extend the approach we developed for EU commercial real estate to further countries and the residential sector.” “Decarbonization pathways based on a transparent methodology that is aligned with the Paris Agreement offer a tool for understanding and managing transition risks, enabling investors to benchmark assets and derive significant risk indicators. The positive industry feedback in the CRREM project confirms this conviction and it seems to be the logical next step to extend the approach we developed for EU commercial real estate to further countries and the residential sector.” Prof Dr Sven Bienert, Managing Director, IIÖ Institute for Real Estate Economics “Property type-specific transition pathways will be an important addition for assessing the ESG performance of both listed and private real estate investment portfolios. The transition pathways enable GRESB to not only assess ESG performance against industry peers, but also against the commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement. For the wider real estate investment industry, the pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the retrofit investments required to transition to a low carbon economy.” “Property type-specific transition pathways will be an important addition for assessing the ESG performance of both listed and private real estate investment portfolios.

Relevant market participants, including investors, managers, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), green rating systems and other stakeholders, are encouraged to share their views on the decarbonization pathways and help develop a common language for assessing climate transition risk in real estate.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/esg-reporting-and-benchmarking-in-the-infrastructure-sector-moves-into-the-mainstream/,ESG reporting and benchmarking in the Infrastructure sector moves into the mainstream,"AMSTERDAM, SEP 9, 2019: GRESB, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2019 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. Participation has increased again in 2019 as the sector responds to the growing investor demand for standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their infrastructure funds and assets. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 43% to include 107 funds. By fund size, the Assessment covers 33 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 75 Infrastructure Investment Managers – participating with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment increased by 40% to cover 393 assets. The Assessment now covers 30 of the 33 industry sectors across 57 countries, leading to deep data insights for investors, fund managers and asset operators. The Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset was launched this year, providing comprehensive coverage of listed infrastructure companies across the GLIO Global Coverage Index. The data reveals which listed infrastructure companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which perform in the mid-range and which are lagging their peers. There was a 62% increase in assets participating in the Resilience Module, which is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Funds also participated in this module for the first time. The uptick in participation demonstrates an increasing awareness of the need to respond to investor attention on climate risks and resilience. Results highlights 57% of funds participated in the Assessment with more than 25% of their assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score, which is an overall measure of ESG performance at the portfolio level. The average GRESB Fund Score remained level with 2018, at 55 points. The average score decreased in the Asset Assessment, from 47.6 in 2018 to 45.5 in 2019, due to lower scores by newer participants. One in three assets participated for the first time in 2019. Participation increased across all sectors in the Asset Assessment. The best performing sector, with an average GRESB Asset score of 63.2, is Network Utilities, followed by Data Infrastructure (52.5), Diversified (52.8) and Energy and Water Resources (52.7). Data Infrastructure notably moved up the rankings from 2018. Social infrastructure was again the lowest scoring sector (29.0).There are clear regional differences in performance. One third of funds are focused on Europe and another third are globally diversified. Europe also has the largest number of participating assets (60%), but the lowest average asset score (42.1). In line with the pattern for the real estate sector, Oceania assets are leading the pack in scoring, with an average of 55.5. 2019 sees the introduction of performance intensity data in asset benchmark reports. Where reported by participants, data on Health & safety, Energy, Greenhouse gas emissions, Water, Waste, Biodiversity & habitat is provided as intensity metrics with comparisons to peers. This is a significant step towards a standardized approach to measuring and scoring assets across different sectors globally. As more sectors provide sufficient observations, these benchmarking possibilities will help fund managers and asset operators of all sectors and regions to better understand and improve their intensity profiles. “Now in its fourth year, we are delighted that the industry continues to endorse GRESB Infrastructure as demonstrated by sustained growth in participation. Following the proven path of the GRESB Real Estate Assessment, we are becoming the global benchmark. We thank the new and returning participants for their diligence and commitment to reporting and engaging on their ESG performance. While the take-up of GRESB Infrastructure since its launch in 2016 has been positive, this year’s results show that there is still much work to do to scale up reporting and impact,” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We look forward to supporting our participant and investor members to use this fresh data in engagement with stakeholders and to build on this platform to accelerate the transformation towards sustainable infrastructure. Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” “Now in its fourth year, we are delighted that the industry continues to endorse GRESB Infrastructure as demonstrated by sustained growth in participation.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/global-real-estate-sector-improves-esg-performance-but-more-effort-needed-to-reach-global-goals/,Global real estate sector improves ESG performance but more effort needed to reach global goals,"AMSTERDAM, SEP 9, 2019: GRESB, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2019 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The results are used by more than 100 institutional investors, representing USD 22 trillion in AUM, to monitor investments, engage with managers, and make decisions that lead to a more sustainable real estate industry. 1,005 property companies, REITs, funds and developers, representing more than USD 4.1 trillion AUM, participated in the 2019 GRESB Assessment. The Assessment now covers more than 100,000 assets, of which more than 66,000 were reported at the asset level. The listed dataset covers 248 entities, representing 65% coverage of the major developed listed real estate indices. The private dataset covers 757 entities, representing 75 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Global Real Estate Investment Managers (participating with at least one fund) and 47 of PERE 100: institutional capital’s top manager picks. The comprehensive nature of the benchmark reveals meaningful global and regional insights and allows us to track the performance of the sector against key national and policy goals such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and the net-zero targets laid down by the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC). Global and regional sustainability scores Globally, the average GRESB Score increased from 68 in 2018 to 72 in 2019, demonstrating a sector making strong improvements in overall sustainability performance. Listed property companies still outperform the private sector, but this gap is now negligible compared to previous years. Similarly, while average GRESB scores for offices continue to outperform other property types, the other sectors are closing in.The regional breakdown of GRESB scores show that real estate companies and funds in Oceania continue to lead the world in sustainability performance, a position the region has held for a remarkable 9 years in a row. In 2019, the average GRESB Score for Oceania comes in at 81 (2018: 76), compared to the global average of 72. Notably, more than half of the GRESB 5-star rated portfolios (the highest rating and recognition for being an industry leader) are located in the region. The average GRESB Score for the Asian real estate sector is now 72 (2018: 66). This is close to the global average and second only to Oceania. The listed sector largely accounts for this uptick in performance, significantly outperforming the private real estate sector in the region. This pattern differs from other regions, where sustainability performance is increasing faster in the private sector.Both the European and American real estate sectors have improved average GRESB Scores in 2019. America comes in with a score of 72 (2018: 70), nudging slightly ahead of the European GRESB Score of 71 (2018: 66). Once again, Europe leads the world in transparency with the highest number of entities participating in the benchmark, while the North American GRESB cohort remains the largest in dollar terms globally. More improvement needed to reach global goals With increasing sustainability scores around the world, the data tells the story of a sector stepping up decisively to respond to investor demand for greater ESG transparency and performance. But it’s also clear that more improvements are needed to meet key global goals and achieve the transition to a low-carbon, resilient and more sustainable future.The 2019 results show global like-for-like GHG emissions falling by 2.66%, a lower rate than the 4.91% reduction achieved in the previous year. This slower reduction rate will not be enough to meet the 1.5-degree target set out by the Paris Climate Agreement. After three years of consecutive reductions, global energy consumption increased by 0.20%. And with only three net-zero portfolios in the 2019 benchmark, much more still needs to be done to shift the sector to a sustainable path.At the same time, the 2019 results show many encouraging developments. For example: 88% of GRESB participants have annual performance targets linked to ESG outcomes (up from 83% in 2018)69% of entities now have Board-level financial compensation linked to ESG goals, an important indicator of ESG integration at the highest levels of governance.90% of GRESB participants monitor employee satisfaction, 81% monitor tenant satisfaction and 79% monitor impact on the community, putting the conditions in place for improvements in social aspects of ESG.In its second year, there was a 96% increase in entities participating in the voluntary Resilience Module, which is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The uptick in participation demonstrates an increasing awareness of the need to respond to investor attention on climate risks and resilience.Participants are including health and well-being as an explicit component of their ESG strategy. Added to this, our trend analysis for indicators that have remained consistent over the past years shows a significant shift in practice. For example: In 2009, 19% of participants collected energy data. In 2019, it’s 98%In 2009, 13% of participants used renewable energy. In 2019, it’s 61%In 2009, 59% of participants obtained green building certificates, in 2019, it’s 63% at the time of construction and 58% for operational buildingsIn 2011, 39% of participants incorporated sustainable factors in their Board of Directors. In 2019, it’s 41%In 2012, 70% of participants had a senior decision-maker accountable for sustainability, in 2019, it’s 99%In 2012, 26% of participants had sustainability clauses in their lease contracts. In 2019, it’s 86%; “Even in the face of present challenges, we remain optimistic because of the breadth and depth of the sustainability ecosystem that has grown up since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009. Looking back, it has been a remarkable decade of movement building that has laid the groundwork for exponential progress to be made in 2020-2050,” says Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB. “We congratulate all 1,005 companies and funds that reported on their ESG performance this year. The leaders today are building on the important work of their predecessors, just as they pave the way for future efforts to achieve our shared vision for a sustainable real estate sector.” “Even in the face of present challenges, we remain optimistic because of the breadth and depth of the sustainability ecosystem that has grown up since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009.

Over the past three years, the Module demonstrated an increasing level of interest in health and well-being among leading real estate companies and funds. Module participation grew from 174 funds in 2016 to 297 funds in 2018, representing a third of GRESB Real Estate participants. The Module has also demonstrated that companies and funds are able to make meaningful improvements to their health promotion efforts within just a few years. While the GRESB Real Estate Assessment had existing indicators related to aspects of health and safety, the Health & Well-being Module provided an opportunity to test new indicators explicitly focused on the promotion of health and well-being for organizational employees, tenants, and customers. After three years of testing, health and well-being indicators that showed high levels of performance have been moved to the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. GRESB Participants will find a new “Health & Well-being” portion within Stakeholder Engagement with four new health and well-being indicators, two of which are unscored and voluntary in 2019. Additionally, participants are now able to report the presence of health and well-being policies as entity-level policies impacting social issues within the Policy & Disclosure aspect. In the fall, GRESB participants and investors can expect to see a new health portion of the GRESB Benchmark Report which will communicate how a real estate fund performs across all health-relevant GRESB indicators. Check out the new health indicators in the 2019 GRESB Real Estate Assessment and stay tuned for the release of a Green Health Partnership & GRESB Health Report this summer which will provide additional insights from the GRESB Health & Well-being Module."

CRREM defines science-based decarbonization targets and pathways specifically for the commercial real estate industry. Targets are consistent with the EU commitment to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C but for the first time, broken down per country and by eight property types. Current national climate pledges (NDCs) are not enough to meet the Paris goals and could lead to a 2.7 – 3.0°C global warming. More ambitious climate policies are needed and likely to come into force in the future.CRREM emission targets and pathways for individual buildings and portfolios are derived by downscaling the remaining 1.5°/2°C consistent global carbon budget to the EU commercial real estate sector, individual countries and subsectors, for example, office or hotel.European commercial properties will need to reduce their carbon emissions by more than 80% until 2050.The EU commercial real estate sector is 14 years behind schedule: At the current rate of emissions the carbon budget available until 2050 will be fully consumed in 2036.The pathways and targets provide benchmarking roadmaps for individual properties, enabling investors to assess the ‘stranding risk’ of their portfolio and pro-actively address the decarbonisation of their assets."

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-b-capital-partners-pilot-esg-due-diligence-tool-for-infrastructure-assets/,GRESB and B Capital Partners pilot ESG Due Diligence Tool for Infrastructure Assets,"GRESB and B Capital Partners AG joined forces to pilot an ESG due diligence tool for infrastructure asset investments with the goal to develop a standard process to improve both the quality and efficiency of ESG due diligence. B Capital Partners developed a pilot ESG Infrastructure Asset Investment Due Diligence Tool using the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment as a basis. The tool has two goals: for GRESB to offer investors and managers a high quality, on demand ESG due diligence service, supported by its proven platform and processes, in the context of e.g. acquiring new assets or regular assessments of assets for revaluation in annual financial statements, andcontributing to an international ESG due diligence assessment standard by making the tool available as open source, encouraging feedback to improve it further. It is only when the results of ESG assessments are integrated into the business case that they get the appropriate attention. Integrating ESG factors in the due diligence will help to better understand the business in general and investment risks in particular, which in turn enable investors to reduce, mitigate or control certain risks, improve the overall risk/return profile and maximize long-term investment returns. There is currently no internationally accepted ESG-assessment standard for the ESG due diligence of infrastructure assets. This leaves investors to largely judge for themselves what they want to integrate in their evaluations, how to find the data for it, how to quantify the risks and opportunities, and how to publish and use the results. In order to address this problem, B Capital Partners and GRESB conducted an ESG-due diligence pilot on the basis of 10 plus years of infrastructure due diligence experience. During the pilot, the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment was modified to reflect the change of focus from benchmarking to due diligence and adapted to a checklist form. The checklist supports the ESG due diligence process and ensures all ESG risks and opportunities associated with the asset in question are identified. The most material “red-flag” issues are then summarized in the “red-flag” report together with potential mitigation measures. In the future, GRESB plans to integrate this service into its existing, proven platform for ESG Assessment. This will simplify and standardize the process of ESG due diligence for the entire industry – addressing the lack of specific ESG due diligence knowledge and resources among investors. Features of the service are expected to include: online, on demand availability for data input, validation of the submitted data, constantly available “punch lists” and red flag reports, which point to the most material ESG findings, as well as scoring and benchmarking against GRESB’s ever growing database of infrastructure assets, and standardized reporting systems. Once the ESG due diligence document is online, all participants of the infrastructure and investment industry are invited to use the open source standard. The feedback from the industry will be used to refine the methodology and lay the basis for a widely accepted and transparent ESG due diligence standard for infrastructure asset investments. Going forward GRESB will build the Due Diligence Assessment into its online portal and offer this as an online support service. Update June 2020: ESG due diligence tool (ESG DD Tool) for infrastructure assets has been released. Read the announcement.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2018-in-review-and-the-road-ahead/,GRESB: 2018 in Review and the Road Ahead,"2018 was another inspirational year for GRESB. A growing number of institutional investor members, now controlling assets valued at USD 18 trillion, called on real estate and infrastructure managers to report on their ESG performance. The industry responded decisively, with 903 real estate companies and funds, 75 infrastructure funds and 280 assets stepping forward to participate in the benchmark. 79,000 real estate assets valued at USD 3.5 trillion are now represented, with infrastructure coverage growing to USD 0.6 trillion. The infographic below collects together the highlights of the year in numbers: This process of annual ESG performance benchmarking on such a large scale has built a powerful global ecosystem of investors, managers and industry bodies empowering everyone to work towards a shared vision of sustainable real assets. It’s been a pleasure to see best practices diffuse across the world and witness first-hand the power of capital markets to shift the real asset industry towards a more sustainable path. But even with ESG action accelerating around the world, there is much more work ahead of us. In many ways, the stakes have never been higher for the industry and GRESB to drive forward the sustainability agenda. As we approach 10 years since we launched the inaugural GRESB Real Estate Assessment, it’s time to take stock of our progress and look ahead to the next phase of our work. As an industry-led benchmark, this process begins by soliciting feedback from our governance bodies, listening to member commentary from GRESB working groups, and engaging with the broader industry that relies on our Assessments and benchmarks. Over the years, as GRESB coverage has grown and new use cases have emerged, a consistent theme has come up in our discussions: The need to offer greater reporting flexibility and more customized outputs. The clear message is to add this flexibility while still providing a single, standardized benchmark that can be applied across portfolios of real asset investments globally. Introducing the next generation of ESG benchmarking and disclosure Building on everything we have learned from almost a decade of benchmarking ESG performance, we’re designing a new approach to our Assessments that will provide access to consolidated ESG performance at the portfolio level, underscored by improved data quality at the asset level. The transition will take place progressively from 2020, when both the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments will be divided into two complementary parts: A Management Component and a Performance Component. The two components reflect the existing dimensions of the GRESB model, as well as natural differences in what ESG data is collected by participants, how it is collected, and the type of entity that collects it: The Management Component will focus on entity management, policies and processes, comprising relatively static information collected at the organizational or portfolio level. The Performance Component will cover annual performance data derived from the asset level. The GRESB Score – calculated as a combination of the Management and Performance Components – will remain in place as the ultimate expression of ESG performance. While additional layers of flexibility will be available to both participants and investors, the overall GRESB Score will continue to underpin the GRESB ratings and drive the global benchmark, just as it does today. Figure: The overall GRESB Score calculated as a combination of the Management and Performance Components Improving usability, experience, data quality and analytics The Management Component will open up the Assessments to new participants not yet reporting to GRESB. For example, it will provide a logical first step for participants getting started with their ESG integration (including those in emerging markets), enabling them to become familiar with the GRESB reporting process, identify priority issues and map out their sustainability program. New mandates that are raising capital, undergoing due diligence, or constructing a portfolio will also find value in the Management Component as a way to share structured ESG information with investors during the fundraising process (thereby replacing the current Real Estate Pre-Assessment). The Performance Component will enable us to introduce a new suite of data-driven benchmarking tools and flexible outputs for participants seeking more granular asset-level insights. For example, the ability to create customized peer groups, compare sub-portfolios, and explore the contribution of an individual asset to portfolio environmental or social outcomes and impacts. This means creating simple, at-a-glance views in the GRESB Portal of specific metrics that a participant is interested in, together with new aggregated data insights for investors. This new Assessment structure will extend the reporting timeline, reducing pressure on participants to report only during a three-month window. The goal is to significantly reduce the reporting burden via streamlined asset-level performance data updates in the Performance Component (e.g., by using GRESB API connections) while requiring regular updates to the more static organizational information reported via the Management Component. For our institutional investor members, splitting the Assessments into the two component parts will allow us to create more tailored and context-appropriate analytics. Some GRESB investor members are now seeking tailored portfolio reports using custom indicators, or KPIs aligned with initiatives such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the TCFD recommendations as well as other broad-based reporting frameworks such as GRI, PRI and SASB. Others are looking for enhanced portfolio foot-printing based on accurate, aggregated portfolio level data and alignment with investor-led initiatives to tackle climate change. We’re also receiving interest in using flexible aspect weightings in the Portfolio Analysis tool, along with the ability to define materiality for different investment strategies and portfolio construction approaches. Benchmarking real-world performance and impact The way ESG factors are being adopted into mainstream investment decisions continues to evolve. We’re already starting to see new models of investor behavior from our member base that integrate measures of impact alongside risk and return. The division of our Assessments into the two component parts will enable us to better support this market trend. Specifically, management inputs and outputs (e.g. policies put in place and measures taken at the organizational level with the intent to improve ESG performance) will be addressed by the Management Component. The outcomes and impacts realized by these actions will be captured in the Performance Component. The diagram below illustrates this progression. Figure: GRESB Assessment Structure 2020 While measuring impact is not an easy task, an industry consensus is slowly coming into view on how best to do this. We’re seeing this among our Investor Members where there is an emerging convergence toward aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the TCFD recommendations. This is an evolving area and we are focused on working closely with our members and the broader industry to ensure our indicators are firmly aligned with the most important frameworks and designed to help participants understand their impacts and progress toward targets. We will underscore this keener focus on performance in two ways: First, by progressively placing a higher weighting of the Performance Component towards the overall GRESB Score and second, by introducing a requirement for asset-level reporting. This dual approach will provide multiple industry benefits including new granular analytics for participants, increased investor confidence in the quality of reported ESG data, and better benchmarks of sector progress at the aggregate level. In addition, with ESG risks becoming more acute and material to long-term performance, expectations around quality and validation are growing. That’s why we have started the process of developing a new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard to define the rules for high-quality data reporting. The Standard will draw on best practices and principles in data quality used by experts across different industries, applying them to ESG data to complement our existing validation processes. Read more on the GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard. Focus areas for 2019 In 2019, we will engage with a broad cross-section of industry leaders, advance critical global conversations with our investors, participants and partners, and establish the building blocks for the GRESB Assessments from 2020 onwards. A crucial success factor will be the constructive collaboration between all our stakeholders as we work together to raise the bar for global ESG performance benchmarking. Our focus areas align with the three strategic pillars that guide our planning process: Stakeholders, Technology and Assessments. 1. Stakeholders: Investors, Participants and Partners Ever since GRESB came into predominance as an initiative of a group of institutional investors, we have developed our strategy in direct dialogue with the industry. GRESB has grown tremendously since the inaugural Assessment in 2009, as has our membership community, which now brings together the collective wisdom of the world’s leading investors, managers, consultants, industry associations and data providers. Honoring our industry-driven legacy and the role our members play in defining ESG concepts for our sector, we are committed to providing greater opportunities for GRESB Members to contribute their leadership in shaping our Assessments and benchmarks. To facilitate this, we will be making clearer distinctions between participants and Members, laying the groundwork for a more intuitive organizational structure that provides greater long-term value to our stakeholders. 2. Technology: IT & Analytics Platform and Portal The rapid advances of technology and big data taking place across the real asset industry are a rich source of opportunity for GRESB and benchmark participants. Together we’re creating a comprehensive industry-specific ESG performance data ecosystem, as well as the assurance structure and science to make it reliable and meaningful. This past year GRESB significantly invested in our data science and platform development capabilities. This coming year we will continue to further invest in the platform to improve usability, experience, data quality and analytics. 3. GRESB Assessments: Real Estate, Infrastructure and Debt GRESB Real Estate participants should expect enhancements to asset-level reporting functionality and the integration of selected Health & Well-being Module elements. Developments to the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment will include aligning sector classifications to industry standards, refinements to the materiality-based scoring process, and further standardization of Performance Indicators to ensure greater comparability of performance data within and across sectors. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment will benefit from a redesigned Fund-Asset linkage in the Portal. The Resilience Module will enter its second year with a strengthened scoring model and new indicators aligned with TCFD recommendations. In late 2019, we plan to release the first version of the new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard designed to provide industry guidance for high-quality data reporting. The goal of the Standard is to reduce reporting and validation efforts, while at the same time improving the reliability and quality of ESG data used and reported by the industry. Over the last four years, the GRESB Debt Assessment has rated and ranked the quality of ESG integration among real estate lenders. While a motivated cohort of banks, real estate debt funds and mortgage REITs have found benefit from participating, the Debt Assessment in its current form does not enable investors or participants to evaluate the overall performance of portfolios where debt investments are held alongside real estate assets. Therefore, in place of a standalone Debt Assessment, we will work with lenders to monitor their real estate and infrastructure investments using the GRESB Real Estate and/or Infrastructure Assessments. In parallel, we are in discussions with several partners to evaluate whether they are interested in continuing the Debt Assessment. Thank you for your support: past, present and future None of the success and growth that we’ve experienced over the last nine years would have been possible without you: the institutional investors, fund managers, portfolio companies, property developers, asset operators and owners, industry partners, academic researchers, data partners and other leaders from around the globe who have supported GRESB by joining our shared vision. We also owe a great debt to past and current members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today. Everyone at GRESB is thankful for your leadership, and with you, we look forward to a more sustainable future. Here’s to a happy and impactful 2019 and beyond.

With collaboration embedded in the DNA of both organizations, the MOU will create the basis for coordination, alignment and mutual recognition between the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment and the IS Rating Tools. The vision is to provide asset managers and operators with one “process” that facilitates both reporting to the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment and applying for an IS Operations rating. GRESB and ISCA will collaborate to streamline connections between IS project and asset operations ratings and GRESB assessments for companies and assets with the aim of reducing participant reporting burden, enhancing data validation processes, and maximizing value. ISCA and GRESB will also work together to advance the rigor of the conversation about sustainable infrastructure, which will result in a joint output. “We have an obligation to accelerate and enable sustainability wherever we possibly can, and by partnering with GRESB, we are creating more pathways, making sustainability even more accessible for the infrastructure industry,” said Ainsley Simpson, ISCA CEO. “We’re big advocates of increasing the alignment between sustainability guidelines, frameworks and rating tools in the infrastructure sector. We are excited by this opportunity to work with ISCA to provide greater clarity on what constitutes sustainable performance in infrastructure investments, which then serves as the base for the industry’s collective efforts to help drive improvements,“ said Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure, GRESB. About ISCA The Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia (ISCA) is a certified social enterprise, member-based not-for-profit and the peak industry body for advancing sustainability outcomes in infrastructure. ISCA’s purpose is to accelerate sustainability in infrastructure. ISCA’s values which drive our culture of value creation are: Collaboration | Passion | Change | Knowledge The principle means by which ISCA is advancing sustainability outcomes in infrastructure is through; the development and facilitation of the IS rating scheme, building capacity of industry through training and workshops, engaging industry stakeholders through a community of practice and driving innovation."

CRREM now launched its website, which aims to help investors measure, understand and reduce carbon risks inherent to commercial real estate portfolios. This month has been a wake-up call for investors and policy makers on the risks posed by climate change: The IPCC[1] declares that limiting global warming to 1.5°C is strictly necessary to prevent severe damage to global ecosystems, while the world is heading to 3°C degrees under current projections. The report stresses that the world “requires rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes” and especially “transitions in land, buildings and cities.” The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer for their research on the economics of climate change and sustainable development. The One Planet Summit saw global leaders underscore 12 commitments related to financing climate resilience. The Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco highlighted how local and regional private and public are increasingly committing to climate action. Contrary to the announcement by EU commissioner for climate action and energy Mr. Miguel Arias Cañete in August 2018, the EU has not voted in tougher GHG pledges and plans to stick to the reduction target of 40 % (instead of 45 %) until 2030 (compared to 1990). The world has an estimated remaining carbon budget of 750 billion tons of carbon to limit global warming below 2 degrees compared to preindustrial levels. Given annual emissions of about 40 billion tons, the global budget will be consumed within less than 20 years. The IPCC as well as the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that global emissions will have to peak before 2020 and then trail off steeply if we are to comply with the Paris Agreement. Given that the real estate and construction sector accounts for 30-40 % of all emissions, energy efficiency improvements in real estate are posed to play a pivotal part in curbing global carbon emissions. Understanding the necessary decarbonisation pathways and climate risks is vital for owners of real estate assets. As one of the largest real estate investment managers in Europe, Aberdeen Standard Investments is contributing to this important project which will help investors better understand and act on climate-related financial risk.’ Ruairi Revell (ESG Manager, Real Estate) | Aberdeen Standard Life Understanding the necessary decarbonisation pathways and climate risks is vital for owners of real estate assets. As one of the largest real estate investment managers in Europe, Aberdeen Standard Investments is contributing to this important project which will help investors better understand and act on climate-related financial risk.’ Ruairi Revell (ESG Manager, Real Estate) | Aberdeen Standard Life CRREM conducted an initial industry survey representing EUR 260 billion assets under management to understand how European Real Estate Investors currently measure and reduce carbon risks. The survey showed that while the industry has made significant progress over the last years, there is still much room for improvement. For 50% of the investors, decarbonization is rudimentary or still not a board room topic, 18% do not perform any carbon risk assessments for their portfolio and 32% only partially. Digging deeper, most market participants stated that they currently only focus on operational carbon from buildings. Given that the entire building and construction supply chain needs to be decarbonized, ‘embodied carbon’ (e.g. emissions from production, transportation and disposal of building materials and the construction) and therefore more advanced techniques like LCA and WLC need to be increasingly promoted. The new IPCC-report clearly stresses that all impacts of the real estate industry – regardless if carbon emissions are direct or indirect – must reach zero by 2050. Respondents also made a clear statement regarding their motivation for energetic retrofits: it’s either compliance with regulation (60%) or higher profits (74%). This is an important finding for policy makers to select the “right” instruments to trigger higher retrofitting rates for the existing building stock. Interestingly 60% of market participants state that their internal targets are already higher than what is presently required by regulation. 74% are even aiming to increase their financial budget for retrofits within the next five years significantly. Within the European Union, buildings are responsible for approx. 36% of emissions. As 75% of the EU’s building stock is estimated to be energy inefficient according to current technological standards, environmental regulation in the property sector offers regulators quick wins to reduce emissions. A large number of buildings in the EU will face significant markdowns if retrofit efforts fail to meet rising energy and carbon requirements. Already 24% of the investors stated that they would require a risk-premium for properties with a poor carbon footprint. 15% even consider disinvestment of buildings with poor performing carbon profiles. CRREM will help investors to identify ‘stranding risks’ of inefficient assets to facilitate carbon efficient investment in retrofits. The term ‘Stranding risk’ denotes the risk of premature write-downs or devaluations due to, for example, strengthened carbon regulation or market expectations regarding energy efficiency. Sustainable development is only possible, if we draw the full potential of carbon reduction in the building sector and if investors are aware of the risks entailed by buildings that do not meet climate protection targets.’ Roger Baumann | COO and Head Sustainability Global Real Estate | Credit Suisse Asset Management (CH) Sustainable development is only possible, if we draw the full potential of carbon reduction in the building sector and if investors are aware of the risks entailed by buildings that do not meet climate protection targets.’ Roger Baumann | COO and Head Sustainability Global Real Estate | Credit Suisse Asset Management (CH) 43% of companies responding to the CRREM industry survey stated that they are not familiar with the term ‘stranded asset’, even though enhanced regulation to promote energy efficiency is foreseeable, exposing investors with energy-inefficient buildings to the downside risks of stricter building codes, carbon taxes, and related hikes in energy prices. The CRREM research consortium consists of five EU-based institutions experienced in the field of carbon research in real estate: GRESB, University of Alicante, Ulster University, IIÖ Institute for Real Estate Economics and Tilburg University’s TIAS Business School. While the 2018 GRESB Assessment results show that 71.2% of European property companies and REITs undertake an asset level carbon risk assessment before new acquisitions, and 65.3% do so for standing assessments, there is still no common framework for measuring carbon risks at an asset level within the European Union.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/north-american-real-estate-sector-keeps-moving-forward-with-the-job-of-improving-sustainability-performance/,North American real estate sector keeps moving forward with the job of improving sustainability performance,"Once again, North America’s average GRESB Score – a measure of overall sustainability performance – is higher than the global average. More North American real estate companies and funds completed the new Resilience module than in other regions. 13 Sector Leaders named for their sustainability leadership in 2018. Amsterdam September 20 – In 2018, GRESB scored and benchmarked the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of 220 North American real estate funds and companies on behalf of more than 75 institutional investors. While the number of European entities participating in the 2018 benchmark is larger, at US$ 1.5 billion in total Assets Under Management, the North American GRESB cohort is still the largest in dollar terms globally. The North America real estate sector improved its sustainability performance again this year, with the regional average GRESB Score breaking the 70 mark, up from 64 in 2017. This is higher than the global average (68) and second only to Australia and New Zealand (76). However, when it comes to energy consumption, GHG emissions and water consumption, the average year-on-year reductions posted by the North American sector fell behind global averages. North American entities reported a 1.8% reduction in energy consumption (compared to a 2.5% global reduction); GHG emissions are down 2.9% in the region (globally, emissions are down 4.9%), and water consumption increased by 0.3%, compared to a global fall of 0.5%. 42 companies and funds in North America completed the new voluntary Resilience Module, which is more than in any other regions and a sign that the sector is quickly waking up to the importance of managing long-term resilience risks. These efforts are not surprising given rising interest from institutional investors and the growing costs of unusual weather-related damage in the US and around the world. “The collective industry leadership exhibited by the record number of GRESB participants in North America reinforces the real estate industry’s strong ESG momentum and continued progress,” remarked Dan Winters, GRESB Head of Americas. “With overall sustainability scores increasing once again the industry is getting on with the job of improving sustainability performance and communicating this to investors.” “Property managers from outside of the USA, in Canada and Mexico, also showed improvements.

The non-listed sector, scoring 62, was slightly lagging the global average (67), indicating that private entities in Asia will have to work harder to keep up with global improvements on ESG performance. The increasing attention being placed on sustainability by the listed sector in Asia is also apparent in the rapidly growing levels of public ESG disclosures. Entities in Japan and Hong Kong in particular responded decisively to the growing regulatory and market demands for increased ESG transparency, with a marked uptick in public ESG disclosure levels compared to 2017. Average year-on-year energy consumption for the Asia real estate sector fell by 6.0% – more than in other regions and significantly exceeding the 2.5% worldwide average reduction. Like-for-like GHG emissions were down 3.8%, with water consumption falling 0.8% in the region. “2018 has seen the commitment to improving environmental and social outcomes grow strongly in Asia in response to increasing investor and regulatory demands for better ESG risk management and higher levels of transparency,” says Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “On the environmental front, the reductions in energy consumption stand out, sending a positive message to investors in a sector where efficiency and financial performance go hand in hand. This is supported by initiatives such as the Super Low Energy Program that was recently announced by Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority. The Program promotes the importance of environmental sustainability.” “Social sustainability is also getting more recognition, as industry stakeholders acknowledge the positive impact of the built environment for individuals and communities. The new Green Mark for Healthier Workplaces standard, also launched in Singapore, focuses the attention on creating healthier buildings, which leads to our shared vision of sustainable real assets” Langbroek concludes. “Participation in GRESB has grown again in 2018 as investors seek standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their real estate assets,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “This investor interest, backed up with accurate performance benchmarking, is empowering the spread of sustainable best practices across the world. We congratulate all participants in the 2018 GRESB Assessments. Their efforts are shaping the future of sustainability leadership for the sector.” “2018 has seen the commitment to improving environmental and social outcomes grow strongly in Asia in response to increasing investor and regulatory demands for better ESG risk management and higher levels of transparency,” says Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “On the environmental front, the reductions in energy consumption stand out, sending a positive message to investors in a sector where efficiency and financial performance go hand in hand.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-measurabl-partner-to-improve-esg-data-quality-for-real-assets/,"GRESB, Measurabl Partner to Improve ESG Data Quality for Real Assets","Global real assets benchmarking authority teams up with software pioneer to raise the bar on ESG data quality. AMSTERDAM (September 19, 2018) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, and Measurabl, the world’s most widely adopted software for real estate sustainability data management, have formed a partnership to create a new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard and Quality Metric in order to elevate and enable the use of sustainability data in any commercial real estate transaction. The GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard will be open to all sustainability software companies for the built environment. GRESB Global Partners and GRESB Premier Partners will have the exclusive opportunity to be part of a Data Quality Technical Working Group to provide input and share their expertise with the goal of creating an objective, open standard that will be widely adopted by the industry. Over 900 real estate companies and property funds representing some 79,000 assets valued in excess of USD $3.5 trillion report to GRESB annually, with Measurabl being a primary data partner. Measurabl alone tracks ESG performance on more than 6 billion square feet worth of real estate spread across 70 countries. With GRESB, the two encompass the largest and most comprehensive real estate benchmarking database in the world. “Our goal is to elevate the trust in and credibility of ESG reporting,” explained Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director of GRESB. “As a result, real estate stakeholders will have the confidence to act on ESG data.” Doug Hodge, former CEO of PIMCO, one of the world’s largest investment managers with $1.75 trillion in assets, said, “ESG data is foundational to a well-functioning capital market. Since real estate is such a significant asset class, it will benefit disproportionately from GRESB and Measurabl’s leadership on data quality and building benchmarking.” “Our goal is to elevate the trust in and credibility of ESG reporting,” explained Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director of GRESB. “As a result, real estate stakeholders will have the confidence to act on ESG data.” Doug Hodge, former CEO of PIMCO, one of the world’s largest investment managers with $1.75 trillion in assets, said, “ESG data is foundational to a well-functioning capital market. Since real estate is such a significant asset class, it will benefit disproportionately from GRESB and Measurabl’s leadership on data quality and building benchmarking.” Sustainability, often referred to using the acronym ESG for “environmental, social, governance,” is used by businesses and investors in creating and executing strategies seeking superior financial returns with less risk. It is a key component of real estate investment, lending, insurance, and leasing decisions for which GRESB is by far the most used ESG benchmark. “Real estate is the world’s largest sector, so it can and should take the lead in elevating trust in its ESG reporting,” said Matt Ellis, Measurabl’s Founder and CEO, and former Director of Sustainability Solutions at CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company. “Real estate is the world’s largest sector, so it can and should take the lead in elevating trust in its ESG reporting,” said Matt Ellis, Measurabl’s Founder and CEO, and former Director of Sustainability Solutions at CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company. Sustainability is particularly relevant to real estate since it is one of the world’s most polluting industries, responsible for nearly 71% of US electricity consumption, 39% of carbon emissions, 14% of potable water usage, and 40% of raw materials usage. People spend 90% of their time indoors – the health and well-being implications of which are only now being understood and addressed using technologies like Measurabl. “Data quality is king when it comes to real estate transactions,” said Ray Wirta, former CEO of CBRE and current President of The Irvine Company, one of the largest landowners and developers in the US. “I commend Measurabl and GRESB for pioneering the next step in making ESG something real estate professionals can act upon.” “Data quality is king when it comes to real estate transactions,” said Ray Wirta, former CEO of CBRE and current President of The Irvine Company, one of the largest landowners and developers in the US. “I commend Measurabl and GRESB for pioneering the next step in making ESG something real estate professionals can act upon.” GRESB will coordinate and lead a Data Quality Technical Working Group with the purpose of defining, launching, and maintaining a data quality regime in the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. Measurabl is the Founding Partner of the Working Group and will contribute its Investment Grade™ data methodologies and benchmarks as well as software tools for calculating and displaying data quality metrics. The Partners expect to take one year to develop the Data Quality Standard followed by a year-long pilot period exclusively facilitated by Measurabl. As part of the partnership agreement, GRESB and Measurabl will also jointly host an annual “Leaders in Data Quality” Award where top performers in data quality are recognized. ***** About GRESB GRESB is the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets.

New sector-based materiality scoring tailors the assessment to different infrastructure sectors creating a globally recognized foundation for benchmarking assets on their performance. Moving to standardized sector intensity metrics will give investors comparable data and an ESG framework they can apply to all their investments. 48% increase in funds participating in the Infrastructure Assessment with their underlying assets. 22 Sector Leaders are named for their sustainability leadership and commitment. Amsterdam September 13, 8:00 AM CEST- GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, today released the global results for the 2018 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. The infrastructure sector is responding strongly to the ever-increasing investor calls for greater transparency on ESG performance. Now in its third year, the infrastructure assessment has reached “critical mass” with strong growth in participation – a 75% increase in assets and 17% for funds compared to last year. Notable in this year’s benchmark is the 48% increase in funds participating in the Infrastructure Assessment with their underlying assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score (the ultimate measure of Fund ESG performance for investors). “Now in its third year, we are delighted that the industry has endorsed GRESB Infrastructure by growing participation significantly. We are now well on the way to emulating the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and becoming the global standard,” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We thank the new and continuing participants for their diligence and congratulate them for improving their performance individually and as an industry. We look forward to supporting our investor members to use this fresh data to engage with their funds and assets and enhance their decision making. Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is surely one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” “Now in its third year, we are delighted that the industry has endorsed GRESB Infrastructure by growing participation significantly.

Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is surely one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” This year materiality-based scoring was introduced across the Asset Assessment ensuring that participants were assessed on the ESG issues material to their sector. This work not only has created a foundation for benchmarking assets on their performance but is also providing highly relevant ESG data and insights to the infrastructure market. GRESB infrastructure participants are increasingly reporting on their energy and greenhouse gas emissions and starting to set improvement targets. This increased reporting is allowing GRESB to begin to set sector standards for intensity metrics that provide investors with comparable data they can use to monitor all their investments. “Participation in GRESB has grown again in 2018 as investors seek standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their real estate assets,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “This investor interest, backed up with accurate performance benchmarking, is empowering the spread of sustainable best practices across the world.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/australia-and-new-zealand-real-estate-sector-achieves-8-successive-years-of-sustainable-leadership/,Australia and New Zealand real estate sector achieves 8 successive years of sustainable leadership,"Australia and New Zealand real estate sector once again leading the world in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. More entities in Australia and New Zealand have set internal targets for net zero carbon emissions than other regions. 7 Sector Leaders recognized for their sustainability leadership. Amsterdam, September 12– In 2018, GRESB scored and benchmarked the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of 73 real estate funds, companies and developers in Australia and New Zealand on behalf of 75 institutional investors, an increase of more than 10% on the previous year. For a remarkable eight years in succession, the Australia and New Zealand real estate sector has outperformed other regions. In 2018, the region achieved an average GRESB Score of 76 (2017: 73) compared with a global average of 68. The region is also responding decisively to new sustainability challenges facing the sector. Notably, more real estate companies and funds in Australia and New Zealand have set internal targets for net zero carbon emissions than in other regions. According to the 2018 results for the region, average like-for-like greenhouse gas emissions for the sector have decreased by 4.0%, and year-on-year energy consumption was down almost 2.9%. There is more work to be done to tackle water consumption, which increased year-on-year by just over 1.2% for the region. “The new data paints a picture of a region not only further raising the bar on sustainability performance, but also paving a clear path for others to follow,” says Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “Industry stakeholder collaboration and ambitious target setting are driving the region’s leadership. To illustrate, the sector has explicitly acknowledged the importance of the Carbon Positive Roadmap for buildings that was released by the Green Building Council of Australia earlier this year, which aims to ensure Australia’s competitiveness and attractiveness for investments while fulfilling international commitments to reducing carbon emissions.” “In addition, regional leaders have expressed their commitment to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, implement the TCFD recommendations, and are increasingly focusing their attention on social sustainability. The latter has resulted in more awareness on material social topics such as modern slavery, health and well-being, and community impact.” “The new data paints a picture of a region not only further raising the bar on sustainability performance, but also paving a clear path for others to follow,” says Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “Industry stakeholder collaboration and ambitious target setting are driving the region’s leadership.

The GRESB results also show that 60% of Australian and New Zealand property companies and funds promote tenant health and well-being via their buildings and services, while this is just 24% globally. “The 2018 GRESB results are proving that expectations have fundamentally changed in the real asset sector and investors are increasingly asking for greater transparency about the ESG performance of real asset portfolios,” said Mahesh Ramanujam, chairman, GRESB Board of Directors, and president & CEO, Green Business Certification Inc.

Amsterdam, September 11 – GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, today released the global results for the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. A record 903 real estate companies, funds and developers reported to GRESB covering more than 79,000 assets across 64 countries. This highlights the increasing transparency and measurement of ESG performance across the global real estate sector. Adding the Public Disclosure Dataset, GRESB has full coverage of the major listed real estate indices. Notable in this year’s benchmark is the increased asset-level reporting on ESG data by more real estate companies and funds than ever before.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/preliminary-results-on-esg-transparency-of-listed-infrastructure-firms/,Preliminary Results on ESG Transparency of Listed Infrastructure Firms,"GRESB launched a new Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset to measure the ESG transparency of listed infrastructure companies. GRESB Infrastructure Analyst David Tassadogh’s article on the results of the pilot study was published in GLIO Journal. This pilot study on the level of public ESG disclosure of 71 listed infrastructure firms within the GLIO Global Coverage led to preliminary results suggesting that the infrastructure asset class performs better overall in comparison with real estate. Disclosure on seven ESG aspects across 22 indicators was analyzed and awarded points which resulted in a Public Disclosure Level from A-E. [one-half-first] The infrastructure asset class (using GLIO Global Coverage as the representation) has a high level of public ESG disclosure. More than 60% of firms achieved an A or B as their disclosure level The strongest scores came from European constituents [/one-half-first] [one-half] North American constituents scored lowest with 48% of total points Asia Pacific region averaged 60% of total points available Airport sector displayed the highest average ESG disclosure level [/one-half] Preliminary results suggest that overall, infrastructure companies do a better job on ESG disclosure than their listed real estate counterparts. Comparing the main regions, European infrastructure companies lead the way with companies in Asia Pacific close behind. Americas’ ESG disclosure level was the weakest of the three regions; a result consistent with GRESB’s Real Estate Public Disclosure evaluation.Although these are preliminary results based on a limited sample size, GRESB intends on expanding the analysis in the coming year to capture the entire GLIO Global Coverage."

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/a-liquid-global-sustainable-reits-index-by-reitsmarket/,A Liquid Global Sustainable REITs Index By Reitsmarket,"Brussels, June 7, 2018 – Reitsmarket launches its new global sustainable REITs index. After the successful launch of the Euronext® Reitsmarket Global Balanced Index and the Euronext® Reitsmarket Global Conviction Index in October last year, Reitsmarket now offers investors access to a sustainable alternative. Both the existing Global and Conviction indices, launched in October last year, continue to build a superb track record. Performance since October is 3.62% and 2.03% respectively, above the 1.94% level for the benchmark. Annualized volatility levels at 9.1% and 9.7% respectively are substantially below the 11.2% level for the benchmark.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/mind-the-gap-epra-gresb-close-in-on-shared-sustainability-language/,"Mind the Gap: EPRA, GRESB, close in on shared sustainability language","The European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) and the real estate sustainability benchmarking organization GRESB have completed the comparative Gap analysis of EPRA’s latest Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations (sBPR) Guidelines with the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment that encompasses public and private equity property investments. The Gap analysis concludes that the industry represented by both bodies is, in the main, converging on common definitions of ESG performance in real estate, though further consolidation still needs to be achieved. EPRA and GRESB have recently updated their own frameworks to introduce new social and corporate governance indicators, such as gender diversity, health and safety of employees and assets, to provide investors with a wider set of information to monitor and manage the ESG risks and opportunities of their investments. The extension of the two organizations’ reporting scope was the catalyst for initiating the Gap analysis across their respective guidelines. Hassan Sabir, EPRA Director of Finance said: “There are a bewildering number of standards and frameworks for measuring and disclosing ESG performance in the market, so this first Gap analysis between the two most recognized initiatives in our industry, is an important step towards ensuring we all use and understand a common language and metrics.” Hassan Sabir, EPRA Director of Finance said: “There are a bewildering number of standards and frameworks for measuring and disclosing ESG performance in the market, so this first Gap analysis between the two most recognized initiatives in our industry, is an important step towards ensuring we all use and understand a common language and metrics.” EPRA and GRESB’s Gap analysis streamlines and unifies the number of data sets companies, investors and regulators need to use to make informed and responsible decisions. Corporate and fund management sustainability officers were repeatedly required to complete multiple surveys on their corporate and portfolio performances for often the same overlapping, or perhaps incomparable data. A huge amount of time and costs could be saved if the industry was working from fewer and more unified methodologies, so all stakeholders including companies, investors and regulators would be confident that common definitions and comparable data are used for informed and responsible investments. EPRA and GRESB have always taken similar approaches to disclosing performance data (e.g. energy consumption data) in real estate portfolios. With the new iteration of the GRESB Assessment, the alignment in terminology and interpretation of data becomes stronger as GRESB adopts the concepts of “Landlord and tenant obtained consumption”. Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB said: “The 2018 publicly available gap analysis between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the EPRA sBPR is testament to our shared mission for sector transparency. Our long-standing collaboration is not only reflected in the common language we use, but also in the topics we identify as material for the real estate industry.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB said: “The 2018 publicly available gap analysis between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the EPRA sBPR is testament to our shared mission for sector transparency. Our long-standing collaboration is not only reflected in the common language we use, but also in the topics we identify as material for the real estate industry.” The European Public Real Estate Association is the voice of the publicly traded European real estate sector. With more than 260 members, covering the whole spectrum of the listed real estate industry (companies, investors and their suppliers), EPRA represents over EUR 450 billion of real estate assets* and 94% of the market capitalisation of the FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Europe Index. Through the provision of better information to investors, active involvement in the public and political debate, improvement of the general operating environment, promotion of best practices and the cohesion and strengthening of the industry, EPRA works to encourage greater investment in listed real estate companies in Europe. *European companies only GRESB is an industry-driven organization transforming the way capital markets assess the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of real asset investments.

GRESB participants can already link building certifications via the ‘Certification’ tab within the Asset Portal. However, the addition of the BREEAM certification dataset via the newly introduced API provides another layer of transparency and efficiency to GRESB reporting. The new functionality will be live for the 2018 GRESB reporting period and is the first step in connecting GRESB to a BREEAM certification dataset in this way. Further functionality will be added over time as the two organisations continue to build stronger linkages. “The integration of the BREEAM API marks an important milestone for the industry as it enables seamless and assured reporting of BRE certifications to GRESB. It also represents another step forward in our ambitions to reduce the reporting burden for our respondents” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB.

Promoted by the Long Term Infrastructure Investors Association (LTIIA), this study, will be based on data from GRESB Infrastructure and EDHEC Infrastructure Institute. The study is also part of the EDHEC/LTIIA research chair in the investment characteristics of unlisted infrastructure equity investments. It will be published as an EDHEC Infrastructure Institute publication in 2019. How ESG affects the financial performance has been an important question for many infrastructure investors. This project will help us understand better what the actual market facts are,” said Eugene Zhuchenko, Executive Director, LTIIA. How ESG affects the financial performance has been an important question for many infrastructure investors. This project will help us understand better what the actual market facts are,” said Eugene Zhuchenko, Executive Director, LTIIA. GRESB collects and analyses data on the ESG characteristics of infrastructure investments through an annual Infrastructure Assessment. Likewise, EDHEC Infrastructure Institute collects and analyses data about the financial performance of infrastructure investments and produces performance benchmarks for private infrastructure debt and equity. As a result, combining the data and analyses made by GRESB and the EDHEC Infrastructure Institute provides the opportunity for one of the first empirical studies of the potential relationship between the financial performance of infrastructure investments and ESG characteristics. Frederic Blanc-Brude, Director, EDHEC infrastructure Institute said, “This is the first time we can match financial and ESG performance data and explore the link between these two aspects of infrastructure investment. It promises to be a fascinating study.” Frederic Blanc-Brude, Director, EDHEC infrastructure Institute said, “This is the first time we can match financial and ESG performance data and explore the link between these two aspects of infrastructure investment. It promises to be a fascinating study.” Study outline The study will begin with a review of the various theoretical underpinnings of the hypotheses to be tested i.e. why ESG and financial characteristics may or may not be related. This will be followed by an econometric analysis of the relationship between various financial metrics and ESG characteristics. Testing various models the study will review whether adding ESG characteristics to a model of the risk-adjusted financial performance of infrastructure investments can improve the explanatory power of the model.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/data-is-clear-a-higher-gresb-score-corresponds-with-a-higher-return-for-european-non-listed-funds/,Data is Clear: A higher GRESB Score corresponds with a higher return for European non-listed funds,"A 10 point higher GRESB total score corresponds with a 34 basis points higher annual fund return. That’s the key takeaway from the research paper by Dirk Brounen (Tilburg University) and Maarten van der Spek, July 2017, published by TIAS. The research analyzed the performance of almost 340 European non-listed real estate funds representing well over 200 billion Euros of gross asset value. It examined the relationship between GRESB scores – which provide an overall measure of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance – and INREV returns in order to shed light on non-listed fund performance. The research found that: Early GRESB adopters tend to be larger funds with above average returns, GRESB scores improve the understanding of non-listed fund performance, The link between GRESB scores and higher fund returns strengthens when a time lag is added, and In the absence of fund information, GRESB scores help as an alternative for good governance. This research matters because it adds to the long line of evidence that strong ESG practices in the real estate sector can help drive better performance and shareholder returns over time. This link is driving real estate investors to increasingly consider ESG as a way to identify portfolio risk and opportunity. It also underlines the importance for real estate companies and funds to report more ESG data to the market and engage with investors on their performance. View the full report here."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-data-platform-shows-that-listed-gresb-participants-are-more-transparent-about-their-esg-performance-than-other-listed-property-companies-and-reits/,New data platform shows that listed GRESB participants are more transparent about their ESG performance than other listed property companies and REITs,"Ever since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009, the idea behind GRESB has never wavered: to provide transparency on the sustainability performance of real estate funds and companies so that investors can factor portfolio risks and opportunities into their decision making. This commitment continues today with the release of the new Public Disclosure Snapshot and data platform measuring the level of material environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure by the listed property sector. For the first time we are able to assess any REIT or listed property company, not just those that participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The new dataset was created in response to increasing demand from institutional investors for ESG disclosure across the entire FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index and GPR 250 index. It uses 22 indicators that focus on the topics covered by REITs and listed companies in their commitment to publicly inform stakeholders about material ESG issues. Combined, the indicators provide a Public Disclosure Level expressed through a sliding scale from A to E. A-level companies are the most transparent with a high level of ESG disclosure, while E-level companies are the least transparent with little or no ESG disclosure. Each entity is placed within a comparison group based on country/region, property sector and market value to provide a meaningful market comparison. Here is more information on how the data is collected. With this new information available in the GRESB Assessment Portal, GRESB Investor Members can now review the ESG disclosure level of the entire FTSE EPRA / NAREIT Developed Index and GPR 250 Index. They can see which REITs and property companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which fall into the mid-range and which are behind the curve. And, crucially, they can exploit these differences in the market. 2017 GRESB Real Estate Assessment participants are more transparent about their ESG commitments and performance than companies that do not participate in the GRESB Assessment. Half of GRESB participants (49.7%) have an A-level disclosure, while only 4.3% disclose at an E-level. ESG disclosure is significantly less established in the wider listed universe. 53.3% of companies that did not participate in the 2017 Assessment have an E-level disclosure, while only 3.6% have an A-level disclosure. The data shows that more improvements are needed by listed property companies and REITs if they are to respond to growing investor demand for transparency on ESG performance. See the Public Disclosure Snapshot for more findings, a regional analysis and the list of all REITs and property companies included in the dataset.

To date, 34 states and DC have enacted PACE enabling legislation and 19 states have active commercial PACE program(s). PACE permits commercial properties to obtain long-term, fixed interest rate financing for the installation of energy efficient, renewable energy and water conservation measures. PACE financing is repaid through a special assessment as part of the property tax collection process. PACE is particularly attractive for commercial property owners for a number of reasons, including (i) extended term – up to 20 years; (ii) transfers with the sale of the property to new owner, who continues to benefit from the energy savings; (iii) off-balance sheet financing; and (iv) in certain leases structures, tenant pays the increased property taxes which are offset by tenant’s reduced utility and operation costs. This session will outline the potential opportunities REITs can realize by utilizing PACE in eligible markets. Such benefits include: 100% financing for capital-intensive improvements with no personal guarantees Lower energy costs resulting in cash flow positive projects Owner retains all tax and utility incentives Improve asset value and accelerate sustainability goals Learning Objectives Moderator Dan Winters, Head of Americas, GRESB Speakers [accordion tag=h6] [accordion-item title=”Brian McCarter, CEO, Sustainable Real Estate Solutions, Inc” state=closed] Brian McCarter is CEO of Sustainable Real Estate Solutions, Inc.

Amsterdam – (Sept. 27, 2017) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, today released the results of the second GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. The 2017 Infrastructure Assessment tracks the progress that has been made since the inaugural assessment conducted in 2016, and paints a picture of ESG performance of the infrastructure sector across 24 countries and 25 sub-sectors (including ports, airports, toll roads, telecommunication, conventional and renewable energy, and social infrastructure). The Assessment was founded by 10 leading institutional investors in late 2015, who remain members of GRESB’s Infrastructure Advisory Board. The Assessment provides the transparency investors need to better manage ESG risks, and provides infrastructure fund managers, companies and asset operators with ESG data and analytical tools to improve their ESG performance. The Assessment has two complementary components: A Fund Assessment and an Asset Assessment. Participation in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment and Asset Assessment increased by 25% and 19% respectively, to cover a total of 224 reporting entities. The Fund Assessment focuses on management and investment processes, addressing foundational ESG plans and policies, leadership and accountability, engagement strategies and communications processes. The 2017 GRESB Score, which is an overall measure of ESG performance, increased 55% to 51 (out of 100) in the Fund Assessment, signalling not only improved performance but also wider asset coverage. The Asset Assessment addresses asset-level plans and policies, implementation actions and operational performance. The 2017 GRESB Score in the Asset Assessment improved by 54% to 43 (out of 100). The improvement is strongest for ESG Management & Policies, with scores for Implementation & Measurement coming in lower. I am very encouraged to see the significant progress made by the Infrastructure sector in participation and ESG-performance. With coverage across 24 countries and 25 sub-sectors, GRESB Infrastructure is rapidly becoming the global ESG benchmark for the sector,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The sector significantly improved ESG-performance across all GRESB Aspects of the Asset Assessment. While ESG communication and disclosure practices largely increased in 2017, there is still room for improvement, especially when compared with the higher levels of public disclosures made by the real estate sector.” I am very encouraged to see the significant progress made by the Infrastructure sector in participation and ESG-performance.

(GBCI) and GRESB board member. “The GRESB Infrastructure Assessment is helping investors make investment decisions, while also helping the infrastructure industry see an economic benefit through the tracking of ESG data and metrics.” Sustainable infrastructure is a major driver of economic growth and a key to reducing environmental impact,” said Mahesh Ramanujam, president & CEO, Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) and GRESB board member. “The GRESB Infrastructure Assessment is helping investors make investment decisions, while also helping the infrastructure industry see an economic benefit through the tracking of ESG data and metrics.” Double digit growth in participation rates for both the Fund Assessment and the Asset Assessment. The average GRESB Score, an overall measure of ESG performance, shows strong improvements for both the Fund Assessment and the Asset Assessments. Despite the fact that 88% of infrastructure funds and 91% of infrastructure assets collect ESG data, reporting on ESG performance is not yet common practice. ESG screening of pre-investments is increasing, but tracking of actual ESG performance is still not widely implemented. The most notable improvements in the Asset Assessment score are for ESG Management and Policies, with scores for Implementation & Measurement coming in lower. The average GRESB Asset score varies considerably between different asset sectors, with airports emerging as the best performing sector with an average GRESB Asset score of 56.3. Only 58% of participants undertake any form of impact assessment, which is low considering the fixed nature of infrastructure assets and their vulnerability to environmental risks.

Amsterdam – (Sept. 21, 2017) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, today released the results of the 2017 GRESB Real Estate Assessment for the Asian real estate sector. Globally, a record 850 property companies and real estate funds completed the Assessment, representing 77,000 assets and over USD 3.7 trillion in value. The average GRESB Score increased to 63 points, up 3 from 2016. Listed property companies continue to outperform private entities, and entities focused on offices outperform other property types. The new GRESB data shows tangible improvements in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Globally in 2017 the sector: Reduced like-for-like energy consumption by 1.1% – equivalent to 79,827 U.S. homes, Reduced like-for-like carbon emissions by 2.2% – equivalent to 113,000 passenger cars, Reduced like-for-like water consumption by 0.5% – equivalent to 999 Olympic swimming pools, and Diverted 52.9% of landfill waste – equivalent to 399,008 truck loads. The results show that the energy improvements made in recent years by the global real estate sector are in line with the energy reductions targets as set out in the United Nations-supported Sustainable Development Goals. “We are delighted to see an increase in the number of participants and assets across all regions for eight consecutive years. It’s encouraging that, once again, GRESB participants were able to lower energy, water and carbon emissions. We hope that the commitment and meaningful actions taken by the 850 GRESB participants serve as an example to others and help to drive improved sustainability performance more broadly across the market.” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB “We are delighted to see an increase in the number of participants and assets across all regions for eight consecutive years.

The region’s performance improved again this year, currently standing at an average GRESB Score of 63 – matching the global average. Most notable improvements were made on the aspects of Policy & Disclosure, Risks & Opportunities, and Stakeholder Engagement. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, adds: “This year’s results for the Asian real estate sector show that sustainability is increasingly being integrated with business strategy and execution, supporting the region’s efforts to create healthy working environments, efficient buildings, and sustainable and resilient communities and cities. This positive transformation is being driven by investors. They are not just requiring companies and funds to list ESG-related risks, but they are expecting them to explain how they’re managing these risks. This way, they can determine if both performance and the commitment to improve is in line with their strategies.” “The most important challenge for further improvements in Asia is a change in mindset.” Langbroek explains: “The pace of improvement may be mediated by factors such as short-termism, and limited insight into the added value of sustainable buildings and portfolios. Stakeholders are expected to incorporate a long-term, holistic view on sustainability in order to establish a timely transition to a net zero carbon built environment.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, adds: “This year’s results for the Asian real estate sector show that sustainability is increasingly being integrated with business strategy and execution, supporting the region’s efforts to create healthy working environments, efficient buildings, and sustainable and resilient communities and cities.

This represents a 27% increase in participant numbers, making Australia/New Zealand the fastest growing region for GRESB participation. For the seventh year in succession, companies and funds based in Australia and New Zealand outperformed all other regions. In 2017, the region achieved an average GRESB Score of 73, compared with a global average of 63. However, the Australia/New Zealand score is stabilizing and the gap between the regions is narrowing. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, explains: “Investor demand for transparency will further enhance how ESG-related risks are managed by Australian and New Zealand property companies and fund managers, empowering them to adopt leading sustainability practices. Looking at the results, the region is already performing at a high standard. We see that 94% of regional companies and funds that reported to GRESB are already disclosing their sustainability performance to stakeholders. There is a strong focus on social and governance aspects; 97% have a policy on diversity and equal opportunities, 94% include sustainability-specific requirements in their lease contracts with tenants, while 89% have a community engagement program in place.” Mr. Langbroek continues: “The vast majority has taken actions to improve energy and water efficiency of their buildings, while reducing waste streams. However, there is still room for further improvement in reducing the environmental footprint of the sector. Increased commitment from Australia policymakers is equally important, as it provides a clear incentive to advance to a net-zero carbon built environment.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, explains: “Investor demand for transparency will further enhance how ESG-related risks are managed by Australian and New Zealand property companies and fund managers, empowering them to adopt leading sustainability practices.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/announcing-investor-confidence-project-icp-for-industry-street-lighting-and-district-energy/,"Announcing: Investor Confidence Project (ICP) for industry, street lighting and district energy","AMSTERDAM – (July 3, 2017) – The Investor Confidence Project (ICP) is being extended in Europe to cover energy efficiency projects for industry, street lighting and district energy. ICP is a framework for standardizing how energy efficiency projects are developed and how energy savings are calculated in order to make projects more attractive to investors and building owners. It’s backed up by the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE) Certification that provides third party verification by credentialed Quality Assurance providers that a project has followed the ICP Energy Performance Protocols and originates from a credentialed Project Developer. The ICP Energy Performance Protocols adopted by IREE-certified projects reference best practice project standards to be used in industry, district energy schemes and street lighting upgrades. These protocols allow for the standardisation of project origination, thus reducing transaction costs and improving project performance. This will lead to more projects completed and for greater impact. “Since 2015, with the strong support of the European Commission, ICP has made great progress in introducing standardisation to building energy efficiency projects in Europe,” said Dr. Steve Fawkes, senior advisor, ICP Europe. “With additional support from the European Commission we look forward to extending the principles of ICP into industrial, street lighting and district energy projects.” The expansion will be overseen by the ICP Europe Consortium, which includes EnergyPro Ltd; RdA Climate Solutions in Portugal and Spain; Serimus in Germany; Denskatt in Austria & Bulgaria; and Verco in the UK; as well as Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP) and GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, who will play a communication role to engage with the European investment market. “We are pleased to see the successful ICP framework being extended into industry, street lighting and district energy.” said Lonneke Lowik, Head of Operations, GRESB. The European Commission published an energy policy update in 2016 citing the ICP Europe protocols as “best practice” to maximize environmental performance in new buildings and investor interest and faith in buildings requiring energy efficiency building upgrade projects. In 2016, Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) announced a strategic vision to work together to develop, deliver and promote the Investor Confidence Project (ICP) as the premier global underwriting standard for energy efficiency projects. ICP joined GBCI’s portfolio of credentials and certifications, which includes the LEED green building rating system, to accelerate investment in energy efficiency.

A Dutch-domiciled pooled fund passively managed to this new index has also been launched. The industry-first index is exclusively available to investors using Northern Trust Asset Management vehicles and has been developed in response to demand for a passive approach to real estate investing incorporating environment, social and governance (ESG) factors. “Northern Trust listens to investors and develops solutions to meet their evolving needs. We are delighted to collaborate with GRESB to create this ground breaking index and to launch a fund which tracks the index. This enables passive investors to benefit from the long-term returns associated with listed real estate companies, whilst incorporating sustainable investing principles,” said Hazel McNeilage, managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Northern Trust Asset Management.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-customize-peer-group-functionality-real-estate-benchmarks/,GRESB Customize Peer Group functionality: How real estate managers gain better insights,"Key takeaways The Customize Peer Group functionality is now officially a part of the Real Estate Benchmark Report. You can log in to the Portal between August 1-15 to customize your peer groups. If you choose to use this feature, you will see two rankings: a pre-defined group ranking and a customized group ranking in the 2024 Benchmark Report. For many real estate managers, interpreting and making the most of the vast amount of data generated through the GRESB Assessments can be a challenge. At the same time, investors are increasingly asking for more clarity and comparability in their benchmarks – looking to better understand how their funds compare against peers in various ways. To address these needs, GRESB has introduced a “Customize Peer Group” functionality to its Real Estate Benchmark Reports, which allows participants to tailor their benchmarks to more closely align with the realities of their investment portfolios. Empowering fund managers to define how they are compared against the industry allows them to unlock more insights and have better conversations with investors. How does GRESB pre-define the peer groups? The GRESB Real Estate Assessment offers valuable benchmarking for your portfolio by providing a ranking in context to peers. This information is delivered through GRESB Benchmark Reports which, until 2023, predetermined the peer group that a fund was part of based on an established algorithm. The GRESB definition of a peer group is a set of funds or entities that are categorized together based on similar characteristics to facilitate performance comparison, and it must consist of at least six entities, although the size of those entities may vary heavily. These peer groups do not affect scores but help readers of the report understand the context of the insights provided. The Portal considers three key characteristics when forming and assigning these groups: Property type: The methodology aims to match funds into a peer group at the property sub-type. If this is not possible, it goes to the property type level and then, if needed, to the property sector, requiring at least 75% GAV. Location: The first attempt to create a peer group is at the country level, and if no group can be created it goes to the sub-region, before moving on to the region, and then finally the super-region, requiring at least 60% GAV. Legal status: The methodology aims to match entities with the same legal status for a given peer group, which are: listed, unlisted, or government entity. The methodology behind creating the optimal peer group is through a set of trials. Based on these characteristics, the Portal first aims to match entities at the highest level of granularity and moves outward, becoming less specific if there aren’t enough entities that match at the highest specificity to compile six in a group together. If the minimum requirement for the gross asset value is not met, the funds are placed in the diversified category. Additionally, the investment style of the portfolio, and whether the assets are tenant controlled, can be considered as an added layer of granularity. Using this information, the Portal creates groups with entities that are most comparable. To learn more about the peer group allocation methodology, you can refer to the latest Real Estate Reference Guide. The GRESB Customize Peer Group functionality While the pre-defined peer groups are a useful way to start comparing a fund against peers, GRESB Participants have asked for ways to improve the process by which peer groups were assigned, to better reflect the specific strategies of the fund. So, in the 2023 reporting year, GRESB introduced the functionality for real estate entities to customize their peer groups in a test phase. Prior to receiving their preliminary results, participants could log into the GRESB Portal to see how they were being allocated to peer groups, at which level of granularity, and could indicate their preferences for each characteristic to build a new peer group composition. During the test phase, over 700 real estate entities – from a total of 2,084 – used the functionality. The reasons for changing peer groups were diverse, with no general trend in how entities chose to customize, meaning that the allocation methodology wasn’t inherently flawed, and remains a good first step when paired with the flexibility provided by the new functionality. What was customized during the 2023 test phase? The most frequently changed criterion was location (52% of total participants), the majority of them choosing to add more locations for a less granular selection. Christina Djambazca, Product Manager at GRESB, explains the reason for this trend as “the desire to adjust to the investing reality”. In a recent episode of the Pulse, she illustrates an example of a fund that has most assets located in the Netherlands, but an investor is not specifically seeking to compare against other Dutch funds, rather the larger European market. This serves as an excellent illustration of how investors derive value from Benchmark Reports, enabling them to more clearly assess a given fund within the investable universe. By leveraging the comprehensive data coming from the GRESB universe, investors can make more informed and strategic investment decisions, ensuring a well-rounded and comparative analysis of potential opportunities. Following location, 41% of participants modified by property type, which included actions like adding more property types/sectors, changing sector classifications, or removing property type as a criterion for the peer group. Lastly, 27% of participants changed their group’s nature of ownership classification, with the majority of them selecting both listed and non-listed entities to appear in their customized peer groups. In addition to the main three components (location, property type, and nature of ownership), participants were able to add new criteria for GAV (20% of participants) and/or asset count (18% of participants) as indicators for portfolio size, the classification of open vs. closed end (18% of participants), and commencement year (6% of participants). They could also add or remove the tenant-controlled flag (8% of participants). What was the outcome of changes during the test phase? Within the trial period peer groups, 47% increased in size, gaining an average of 18 entities. In contrast, 32% of the groups decreased in size, on average by 22 entities, while 18% maintained their original size. With the growing size of the peer groups, 39% of participants saw their rank drop by an average of nine places, while 32% improved their rank by an average of 11 places, and 29% maintained the same rank. While one might think that participants might adjust the peer group criteria to achieve higher relative rankings, this was not borne out by the data. There was no trend of participants adjusting to claim leadership within a given peer group by creating favorable conditions. Rather, changes were clearly made to improve allocation so entities would belong to the most relevant comparable universe for their investors. This new feature directly addresses a genuine user need: the flexibility to choose peer groups that provide the most meaningful context for investors evaluating these funds. Next steps for the 2024 reporting year If you wish to use this functionality, you will need to log in to the GRESB Portal between August 1-15. You can see how to select your peer group on the Portal here. What will you see in your 2024 Benchmark Report? If you choose to customize your peer group, you will receive two rankings this year: one with the pre-defined peer group and one with your customized peer group. The main reason is to provide continuity for investors used to seeing the predefined peer groups. You will have access to the details of your customized peer group added to the “Entity & Peer Group Characteristics” section, alongside your pre-defined peer group. One important note: the comparison insights will continue to be based on your pre-defined peer group, and not the customized one, even if you chose to use this functionality. Conclusion The “Customize Peer Group” feature aims to provide more relevant and actionable insights by improving data contextualization. This update, driven by participant feedback, will allow for more tailored benchmark comparisons, supporting better strategic decisions for investors.

Asset Impact Update GRESB’s Asset Impact team is excited to unveil a new set of advanced asset-based climate analytics and forecasts tailored for asset managers and owners. The analytics delivers detailed absolute emissions, emission intensities and activity data from listed companies across 11 climate-critical sectors over an 11-year time horizon. Asset managers and owners can leverage this data to set precise sectoral targets in line with NZAOA guidance, comply with regulations like SFDR, manage climate risks, and strategically allocate capital. Keep an eye out for the launch soon, or contact us at [email protected]. Foundation update Foundation stakeholder engagement The GRESB Foundation continues to expand its engagement with GRESB stakeholders. In May, we hosted a social sustainability roundtable at LaSalle’s offices in London. The event gathered market leaders to discuss how to drive improved awareness around social sustainability, the state of the market, and the metrics and tools to manage effective engagement. The discussion included representatives from AINDA Energia, British Land, Hines, Ivanhoe Cambridge, and PSP Investments, as well as many others. If you would like to engage on the topic of social sustainability or receive the slides and full recap of the event, please email [email protected]. 2025 Standards workplan The Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees continue to endorse proposals for changes to the 2025 Standards, which are then brought to the Foundation Board for approval. (For a refresher on the approval process, please revisit the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap.) During its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board approved the first changes to the 2025 Real Estate Standards, which adjust scoring weights for residential real estate portfolios and aim to more accurately reflect indicators that are inapplicable or less/more material to the residential sector. Standards Development GRESB has received important feedback about the evolution of the Standards from stakeholders around the world, highlighting a priority on the speed and direction of Standards development. In response, the GRESB Foundation Board has unanimously voted on the development of a plan to guide the 2025 Standards development. The plan will include increased acceleration and more thematic transparency. Additional details will be shared in the 2025 Roadmap, which will be published in the fall. Investor update The quarterly Investor Newsletter will be sent to all investor members in the coming days. The highlights include updates on the standards committees, content, tools, and engagement suggestions relevant to Investor Members. If you are an Investor Member and would like to sign up to receive the investor newsletter or are interested in attending a fall Investor Masterclass in NYC or Toronto, please email [email protected].

Through a compelling thought experiment, they illustrate the differing effects of these investment strategies on capital impact, concluding that capital flowing to brown portfolios in any region would have a much larger impact than a comparable investment in already-green assets.

Building certifications: How to impose an expiration date Green building certifications are crucial for assessing sustainable design and performance in real estate. However, since varying global certification schemes complicate this for investors and asset managers, the GRESB Foundation made building certifications a focal point in the 2023 Standards development process, leading to significant updates in 2024. This acknowledges the enduring relevance of certifications, between those issued recently and those awarded over a decade ago.GRESB’s Alodie McLaren, Senior Associate for Real Estate, outlines the need for this update and the implications of it for our members on reporting requirements.

In April, we hosted a webinar about Aotearoa New Zealand’s Climate Standards. Ngā mihi nui to our incredible panellists: Lisa Hinde from Precinct Properties NZ, Kate Gunthorp from Westpac New Zealand, and Bobby Shen from NZGBC. Our key takeaways: There are no returns on a dead planet – sustainability isn’t just an add-on that costs time. The Standards ensure consistent financial risk disclosure for companies, but the message needs to be tailored to the appropriate audience. Investing in the transition is just that – an investment, not a cost. Downstream impacts and potential losses are regularly underestimated. Sustainability needs to be considered holistically, as it will affect everyone on many different levels.

What we’ve been talking about The second quarter of 2024 was a true triathlon for the GRESB Oceania team, swimming to attend various industry events, cycling to deliver webinars, and running to hold masterclasses. Besides the excellent NABERS + CBD Conference (congrats to NABERS on their 25th anniversary) and GBCA’s insightful Green Building Days, we managed to take part in the following events: Investor Masterclass Just as Gianmarco Tamberi and Mutaz Barshim shared their gold medal in the High Jump at the Tokyo 2020 Games, our case study presenters at the Investor Masterclass were all gold medallists to us. Bringing together existing and prospective GRESB Investor Members from across 20 different organisations, the return of the Investor Masterclass format in May was a major success. Our key takeaways: Investors actively engage with their managers using GRESB data to assess and encourage alignment with best practices in ESG. There is an ongoing shift from investors away from simply looking at the scores in the GRESB Assessments – actual ESG performance, including the delivery of positive outcomes, is becoming more crucial over time. Investors are increasingly seeking asset-level performance data to engage managers about on-the-ground performance. Bummer, I missed it! Investor Members can contact us for the summary notes. RIAA Conference We witnessed another record-breaking performance by the RIAA team at their annual Australia conference. Our key takeaways: A lively panel discussion about offsets had Dr Megan Evans talking about the risks of ACCUs and explaining that offsets should be expensive to incentivise carbon abatement, versus business as usual. Prof the Hon Gareth Evans AC KC encouraged us to focus on the geopolitical issues most salient for responsible investors and to value our “reputation for decency”. Joe Longo, ASIC Chair, reminded us that misleading and deceptive conduct has never been acceptable, but environmental factors are now coming to the fore with greenwashing. According to Pablo Berutti from Stewart Investors, transparency itself does not build trust. What builds trust is saying clearly what you’re going to do and then actually doing it. It’s all about accountability. Darn it, I missed it! Check out RIAA’s LinkedIn feed for summaries of the sessions. ULI Asia Pacific Summit GRESB Lead Asia Representative, Yvonne Huang, represented team GRESB at the ULI Asia Pacific Summit in Tokyo this month. Our key takeaways: Learn by doing: Cecilia Tse from Aon New Zealand highlighted that aligning with TCFD and ISSB simplifies compliance and strengthens climate roadmapping. Collaboration is key: Calvin Lee Kwan from Link REIT urged everyone to share data and best practices to create a clearer risk management picture. Keep it simple: Mark Cameron from Nuveen recommended a focus on clear communication and engaging young talent. Gosh darn, I missed it!

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-customize-peer-group-functionality/,New “Customize Peer Group” functionality available,"(This post was originally published in June 2023 and has been updated with new information.) In 2023, GRESB real estate participants had access to a new “Customize Peer Group” functionality in the GRESB Portal. This new feature was made available in a test phase, developed in response to industry feedback. It allowed participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as allocated by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. In 2023, updated peer group selections did not appear in Benchmark Reports, but participants could access rankings against a Customized Peer Group in the GRESB Portal. Thanks to continued member feedback, we are pleased to offer an improved Customize Peer Group functionality in 2024, which will appear in the Benchmark Reports. What you can expect from this functionality In 2024 The 2024 Benchmark Report will include both the ranking against the GRESB predefined peer group and the ranking against the customized peer group. In order to incorporate a customized peer group into the Benchmark Report, the “Customize Peer Group” functionality will be available only from August 1 to 15. Non-listed participants will now be able to see their peers and will be able to add or remove non-listed fund managers from their customized peer group. Users will see improved usability of the functionality based on user feedback. In 2025 The Benchmark Report will primarily rely on the customized group and all benchmarking insights will be calculated based on it. Please note that specific updates are subject to change, as we are continuing to collect feedback from participants and investors to further integrate insights from the Customize Peer Group functionality in future Benchmark Reports. For questions about the new “Customize Peer Group” functionality, please contact the GRESB Helpdesk. Step-by-step guide 1) Log into the GRESB Portal In the Assessment Portal, you will see a new assessment status called “Customize Peer Group.” Please note that only users with an Account Manager access level can confirm or customize an entity’s peer group. 2) Review your predefined peer group Clicking this new status will redirect you to an overview of your entity’s peer groups, as predefined by GRESB. The methodology used is described in the Reference Guide, Appendix 3B. Entities that submit all three Components are assigned to two peer groups – one for Standing Investments and one for their Development portfolio. Users will be able to confirm and/or customize both peer groups individually. If you’re satisfied with the predefined peer group, you can confirm it by clicking the “Confirm Peer Group” button. This action can be completed only once. If you change your mind and want to submit edits, you can do so by clicking the “Customize peer group” button and follow the steps below. 3) Customize peer group If you want to change peer group allocation, click on “Customize Peer Group”. You will be redirected to an overview page of all characteristics that can be modified. It’s pre-filled with characteristics used to define your initial peer group. You can add or remove characteristics. This year, participants can make any selection they wish, even selecting characteristics that are different from their own entity. Listed entities will also be able to select and deselect individual listed participants from their final peer group composition. Participants can confirm their peer group if the characteristics chosen result in six or more entities for that group. This process can be completed multiple times during the month of August until the participant is satisfied with their final peer group selection. Participants will also be able to submit feedback on the functionality and suggest further improvements."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/government-owned-power-generation-portfolios-hinder-progress-towards-eu-climate-goals/,"Government-owned power generation portfolios hinder progress towards EU climate goals, new analysis finds","Amsterdam, June 3, 2024 – New analysis from GRESB’s Asset Impact team on the EU power sector reveals that governments, as the ultimate owners of a significant share of the largest power-generating assets in the bloc, are not accelerating away from fossil fuels fast enough to meet their own 2030 climate goals. The report, Power Players: Ultimate Ownership, Emissions, and Slow Progress in the EU Power Sector from 2024 to 2030, complements the European Central Banks’ landmark study early this year into the misalignment of bank portfolios with climate transition, which relied on Asset Impact’s data in its analysis. This new report by GRESB highlights that: The EU power sector is heavily concentrated: just 20 companies are ultimately responsible for almost 40% of the sector’s total emissions Among the 20 largest generators, a striking 88% of power generation is ultimately attributable to national and local governments Based on currently planned activities, the EU will still use coal and gas to supply 5% and 20% of its electricity, respectively, in 2030, which is misaligned with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 Emissions (NZE) Scenario and the bloc’s own climate goals One of the most striking insights from the new analysis is that many of the ultimate parent companies of EU power assets are not companies at all, but governments. In fact, among the 20 largest generators, 85% of power generation is attributable to national governments, with local governments owning a further 3%. At first glance, these leading national government generators appear to be green giants – with most of the electricity produced in 2024 being from low-carbon sources and less emissions intensive than the sectoral average. (The top 20 generators account for 43% of total generation but only 31% of total emissions.) However, looking at individual ultimate owners in more detail, a nuanced picture emerges. Non-hydro renewable power – primarily solar and wind – is only a significant contributor to the portfolios of four governments: that of Sweden (17%), Denmark (77%), China (29%) and Ireland (21%). At the other extreme, coal and gas dominate the government-owned portfolios of Poland (89%), Germany (90%) and Ireland (70%). Reliance on coal means that Poland’s government is the single largest emitter in the EU, releasing 48.6 MtCO2e in 2024, nearly double that of the next highest emitter, the French government – which has a much larger generation portfolio and a much lower average emissions intensity, owing primarily to its massive nuclear fleet. While this is not surprising given historical dependencies and current capabilities, the laggards will increasingly become isolated and under pressure as others accelerate. Looking into the data we see many positive signals showing a sector in transition: Total emissions are projected to decline by one-third (about 5% per year, annualized) between 2024 and 2030, with almost all top emitters decreasing their emission intensity by 2030. Coal will decline by 60% over the next six years and renewable energy generation will double. “These projections are promising; however, the continued reliance on fossil fuels undermines much of the progress that is being made,” says Alex Clark, Research Director for Asset Impact at GRESB. “With coal and gas still supplying 5% and 20% of electricity, respectively, across the EU in 2030, the sector will not be on track to meet the IEA’s NZE Scenario, which requires net zero electricity emissions by 2035. To reach zero by this date and to stay on track with the IEA’s scenario, total emissions in the EU need to decline more than twice as fast as they currently are over the next six years and coal needs to be completely phased out.” The current trajectory – based on our forward-looking projections using evidence of companies’ actual capex plans, rather than stated assumptions – suggests that governments could and should exert additional direct pressure on the companies they control in the power sector to accelerate decarbonization efforts in line with the bloc’s stated objectives and the IEA’s NZE Scenario. “The slow pace of change we observe from our data will have, as the ECB shows, significant implications for banks with exposure to high-emission assets. To avoid a growing degree of financial, reputational and legal risk, banks must ensure their lending portfolios in the power sector are consistent with climate goals. This requires granular data and rigorous, analytical methodologies,” says Noémie Klein, Chief Impact Officer at GRESB. It is clear from the data that, ultimately, the EU will only achieve its ambitious climate goals if the whole sector gets on track. ### ENDS ### To access the report click here. Media Contacts Tyler GuthrieDirector of Communications, GRESB[email protected] Notes to editors: The scope of our analysis includes power plants located within the EU (i.e. the Euro area plus Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Sweden, and Denmark). Most, but not all, of the power plants in these countries are owned by EU-domiciled companies. We still include non-EU companies with shares in EU assets because foreign companies are not exempt from the EU’s local legislative requirements. We predominately use generation figures because capacity is not a reliable indicator of actual electricity produced given large differences across different power sources. Our forward-looking projections are based on evidence of companies’ actual capex plans, rather than simply assuming they will meet their stated targets. About GRESB & Asset Impact Asset Impact is a suite of GRESB products that support the financial sector to assess and quantify the climate impact of investments using an asset-based approach. With a focus on the most energy-intensive sectors, Asset Impact links carbon emissions of physical assets to corporate ownership trees, from direct owners to parent companies and the securities they issue. The database encompasses 366,000 physical assets tied to over 66,000 public and private companies, representing more than 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. In addition to historical and current emissions data, Asset Impact’s solutions integrate capital expenditure plans and commissioning and decommissioning schedules, providing a comprehensive outlook until 2030."

Global investors expand ESG engagement in APAC For the fourth consecutive year, a group of global investors, in collaboration with GRESB, has increased their coordinated efforts in the Asia Pacific region to engage with the real asset industry on significant ESG disclosures and net-zero strategies. This year’s campaign has expanded to include infrastructure companies for the first time, in addition to listed real estate companies and REITs, resulting in an engagement rate higher than ever before. “It’s great to see global investors using the weight of capital to encourage companies to improve their management of ESG issues. In turn, this can enhance investee companies’ financial performance and the long-term performance of investment portfolios,” said Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. Read more about the collaborative engagement campaign in our press release here. GRESB AP now available The GRESB Accredited Professional (GRESB AP) program, designed to empower professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to excel in sustainability reporting within the real assets industry, is now available. Open to GRESB Members, Participants, Partners, and individuals seeking to expand their knowledge in sustainability reporting, the GRESB AP credential will equip you with the expertise to understand, report, and manage sustainability data and performance within the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Take the GRESB AP exam to qualify for the credential and make sure to renew it annually to keep your knowledge current. The AP certificate is valid for 12 months, and you can start your AP journey here. Foundation update Foundation stakeholder engagement The Foundation continues to actively engage with stakeholders through in-person and virtual meetings, as well as through a quarterly newsletter. The new newsletter includes updates on the Standards Committees as well as content, tools, and engagement suggestions relevant to Investor Members. If you are an Investor Member and would like to sign up to receive the investor newsletter, please email [email protected]. In March, we hosted a social sustainability roundtable in Sydney and recently an Investor Masterclass, which included presentations by APG, Hesta, NSW Treasury Corporation (TCorp), and VFMC, in addition to another Social Sustainability Roundtable in London last week. If you would like to receive updates on our social sustainability efforts, please email [email protected]. The next Investor Masterclass (virtual and in-person) will take place in London on Wednesday, June 26. 2025 Standards workplan The Real Estate (RESC) and Infrastructure Standards Committees (ISC) have begun to endorse the first proposals for changes to the 2025 GRESB Standards, which are then brought to the Foundation Board for approval. (For a refresher on the approval process, please revisit the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap.) During its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board approved the first changes to the 2025 Infrastructure Standards: introducing data coverage across key metrics and standardizing Scope 2 GHG emissions reporting. The ISC is hopeful these two proposals will help to tackle key issues for the GRESB Infrastructure Standards, including: Creating score differentiation for top performers Moving towards scoring performance rather than disclosure Increasing data quality There is still an immediate opportunity for Investor Members to participate in the public consultation on building certifications, which will support the revision of building certification criteria and ultimately affect the scoring of each certification scheme within the GRESB Real Estate Standard. Standards Committee members in-person meeting The Standards Committees will host their first in-person meetings this month. We are pleased the majority of RESC and ISC members can attend the event, and GRESB hopes to find ways to connect in person in the future. During the in-person gathering, both committees will host an extended version of their usual meetings, during which they will continue to work through their 2024 workplan. They will also participate in a joint committee networking session alongside the entire Foundation Secretariat and the Foundation Board chair.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-joins-international-alliance-to-further-drive-built-environment-change/,GRESB joins international alliance to further drive built environment change,"Amsterdam, May 22, 2024 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments, is excited to announce that it is joining the existing international alliance between the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the UK-based Building Research Establishment (BRE), and the Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA), to further collaborate and drive change in the built environment. In total, the alliance is expanding with four new partners: Singapore Green Building Council (SGBC), GRESB, the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI), and the CRREM – Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM). To mark this partnership milestone, the alliance will be publishing a guide, “Financing Transformation: A Guide to Green Building for Green Bonds and Green Loans”, to showcase how verification and certification schemes can meet global sustainable classification frameworks and support the 1.5°C climate trajectory. GRESB’s Chief Innovation Officer, Dr. Chris Pyke, commented that: “GRESB recognizes green building as an important tool to inform institutional investment in real assets. The new guide will help increase the social and environmental impact of capital invested in green bonds and loans.” To further consolidate the bolstered alliance and officially mark the publication of the guide, the alliance will hold an event entitled “Uniting the global built environment to drive climate action” during London Climate Action Week on June 27, where leading voices for sustainable development will convene to discuss, among other diverse topics, the role of the built environment in addressing the accelerating challenges of climate change.

GRESB stands ready to help in any way we can, and our Member Success team ([email protected]) includes a wide and dedicated group of staff waiting to provide answers to your questions.

For now, let me wish everyone a smooth and productive GRESB reporting period. Regards, Tom Idzal GRESB Head of Americas Arcadis on SEC climate rule & ESG regulatory evolution While the SEC’s climate-related reporting rule, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, was put on hold just days after it was published last month, it remains an important regulatory milestone in the US, signaling that more – rather than less – regulatory pressure is on the horizon for US-based reporters of all types. Globally, regulation like the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is rapidly taking hold, and many organizations are seeking to align with CSRD and other frameworks like it to ensure consistent disclosure to stakeholders, regardless of geography. At Arcadis, we expect the SEC rule to follow a similar trajectory. While scaled back from its original ambition, and currently facing legal challenges, it remains an indicator of what is to come for reporting organizations on this side of the Atlantic. Read Arcadis’ summary of the SEC rule here.

Nareit Leader in the Light Update Since 2012, Nareit has awarded REITs across several property sectors a Leader in the Light Award based on their GRESB Scores from the Real Estate Assessment, and a supplemental submission evaluating their organizational strategies and performance. The GRESB Real Estate Assessment will continue to be the basis for the annual Leader in the Light Award. However, this year, the supplemental submission will be completed separately from the GRESB Assessment. To participate in the Leader in the Light Award program, Nareit members must complete both the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the separate supplement, administered by Nareit. Once all sections of the GRESB Real Estate Assessment are completed and the supplement submitted to Nareit, participants will automatically be included in the Leader in the Light Award competition.

General Atlantic will acquire its stake from existing shareholder Summit Partners, which will retain a minority position in GRESB following close of the transaction. GRESB intends to partner with General Atlantic to support its next phase of growth through strategic expansion and product innovation and to accelerate impact across financial markets. Founded in 2009, GRESB provides sustainability standards, benchmarks, and actionable insights for real assets. General Atlantic’s majority investment and partnership are a testament to the alignment of vision and shared values between the two organizations. With this investment, GRESB will remain an independent Benefit Corporation, expanding its support to a global community of real asset investors, managers, and partners. The affiliated not-for-profit GRESB Foundation will continue to provide industry-led strategic direction and governance over the GRESB Standards. The GRESB management team will reinvest into the company and continue its ongoing work driving GRESB’s growth and impact. General Atlantic’s investment aims to allow GRESB to expand its work on transition finance, fixed income, the REAL Solutions family of services, and more. Sebastien Roussotte, Chief Executive Officer, GRESB, commented, “GRESB looks forward to contributing to BeyondNetZero’s vision for climate action powered by technology, innovation, and entrepreneurship. This vision underpins GRESB’s industry-led approach to creating global standards that increase market transparency and accelerate the clean energy transition.” Rhea Hamilton, Managing Director at General Atlantic’s BeyondNetZero, said, “GRESB has established itself as the industry standard for benchmarking across real assets. With buildings and real estate accounting for 40 percent of global greenhouse emissions, data is key to unlocking the opportunity to deliver net-zero, resilient assets. We believe GRESB’s management of asset-level data and compelling value proposition deepen the Company’s position as an enabler of decarbonization for investors and asset managers.

We believe that the Company is backed by long-term tailwinds as decarbonization and ESG benchmarking become core metrics for LP portfolios. We intend to leverage General Atlantic’s expertise at the intersection of innovative data, technology, and climate solutions to support GRESB in its continued expansion and product development.” “We have been proud to work alongside Sebastien and the entire GRESB team to support the company’s significant growth and expansion over the last four years,” said Johannes Grefe, Managing Director at Summit Partners. “We believe GRESB’s commitment to providing industry leading ESG data and benchmarking solutions will continue to play a pivotal role in driving sustainable investment practices worldwide,” added Chris Bon, Principal at Summit Partners. GRESB benchmarks and insights are generated from data self-reported through annual assessments for standing real estate investments, real estate projects in development, infrastructure funds, and infrastructure assets – both operational and in various stages of development. Each year, GRESB publishes global aggregated benchmark data that highlight the state and continued progress of ESG in the industry. The GRESB Standards, upon which its benchmarks are based, evolve over time based on input from industry representatives who sit on and work with the GRESB Foundation. This ensures that assessments are guided by what investors and the industry consider to be material issues and that scores reflect evolving sustainability expectations. Through its assessments, benchmarks, and related products, GRESB enables investors to make more informed decisions; empowers companies, managers, and asset operators to improve their sustainability rating through ESG insights and best practices; and encourages the wider real assets industry to embrace and promote ESG transparency and collective action.

What we’ve been talking about We’ve been talking with many of you about several big-picture topics this month including, but certainly not limited to: Thank you to our Partner, JLL, for hosting our GRESB Foundation Roundtable. We brought together representatives from more than 30 different Real Estate and Infrastructure Participant Members and Partners for a lively discussion about the future of the GRESB Standards. Our key takeaways: We discussed key areas of development such as net zero, materiality, building certifications, indicator retirement, and Like-for-Like scoring Challenges include balancing the needs of different stakeholders across the real asset industry and ensuring high data quality Related to emissions calculations, we discussed the ability to normalize for climate zones and occupancy rates Homemade Dutch brownies are now a tradition for formal GRESB stakeholder engagement events Bummer, I missed it! If you were unable to attend and would like a fuller summary of the discussion, drop me a line and I can share the summary notes with you. We were delighted to co-host a packed room for a roundtable on the topic of investor engagement with social sustainability, alongside our Industry Partners GBCA and IWBI. Our key takeaways: “Being a jerk isn’t good for business anymore” You can’t capture the complexity of social value/impact through metrics alone. It’s also about storytelling Nevertheless, investors do require comparability Data is good, but you need to be incredibly transparent about the methodology of how you collect, measure, and assess social value/impact Darn it, I missed it! Get in touch and I’ll share the follow-up when available. As per the GRESB Foundation 2024 Roadmap, the Foundation is exploring the concept of sectoral materiality in the Real Estate Assessment, beginning with the residential sector. Many thanks to our GRESB Investor Members who took the time to discuss this concept with our colleague Charles van Thiel, Director, Real Estate. It was fantastic to see so many friendly faces at GBCA TRANSFORM and to have our Chief Innovation Officer, Chris Pyke, on the main stage as a speaker. Our highlights: The incredible and complex interaction of First Nations communities with nature and ecology — how centering cities with First Nations-led design can help us live better as part of nature In the world of regulations, we need to ensure that standards are aligned with the green building movement. If not, we might get dragged under the train Untrashing the world through sustainable sunglasses truly is possible Holy moly, I missed it! Look out for conference-related content on the GBCA website. Thank you to our new Industry Partner, MECLA, for the invite to their roundtable session discussing the role of the finance sector in supporting the decarbonization of the built environment with a primary focus on reducing embodied carbon. What you can read or listen to After you finish the Easter egg hunt, break the fast at Eid al-Fitr, or await your Passover celebrations, make sure to check out: In The complexity of defining and measuring social value, I wrote about why investors are increasingly demanding reliable social impact data, prompting real estate management entities to intensify efforts to gather, report, and analyze such indicators. Hassell and GBCA have come together for a discussion paper, Social Value in the Built Environment. We loved that it brings together global and Australian work about social value to raise awareness and that it is a very accessible document. GBCA is keeping itself busy and released a discussion paper, A nature roadmap for the built environment. The paper evaluates environmental risks and opportunities pertinent to the industry, explores innovative concepts for nature regeneration, and clarifies the collaborative roles required. Your feedback is much appreciated by both the GBCA and by Mother Nature.

Current criteria provide a large number of schemes with full recognition and limited information to inform scoring and analysis. Therefore, the Real Estate Standards Committee (RESC) is collaborating with industry stakeholders to: Elevate best-in-class schemes, encouraging broader adoption within the industry Refine the list of accepted schemes, recognizing those with the greatest credibility and impact Enhance transparency on key evaluation metrics, informing investment decision-making Learn more about the public consultation and sign up to provide your feedback here. Infrastructure Standards Committee (ISC) update The ISC has recently discussed the importance of data coverage, agreeing on the need to develop changes to reward coverage across all key performance metrics in 2025. Understanding data coverage levels allows data consumers to make more informed management decisions while also opening the door to developing other insights and comparisons over time and between entities. Furthermore, the Committee unanimously agreed on the need to standardize Scope 2 reporting across all reporting entities and will score location-based reporting while also allowing for the option to report market-based values. This approach provides consistency across all reporting entities, while also acknowledging the importance of market-based efforts from infrastructure actors. GRESB Foundation update The Foundation Board recently hosted its annual in-person meeting in London and the overarching theme was “Savvy investors look beyond the simple GRESB Score.” To provide investors with value beyond a simple numerical score, the Foundation is discussing how to: Reduce reporting burden to help GRESB Members efficiently address their regulatory and voluntary data demands Provide decision-useful information to investors to better inform the ongoing dialogue with managers Mitigate against greenwashing to support the efficient flow of capital toward sustainable assets A critical part of this effort involves improving communication with Investor Members, who have recently begun receiving a quarterly update from the Foundation. Investor Members are also encouraged to register for the upcoming Investor Masterclass, which will be held virtually and in person in Melbourne, Australia, on May 14 at 10am AEST/May 13 at 8pm EDT and express interest in attending an Investor Masterclass (virtual and in person) in London, UK on May 21.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-announces-public-consultation-on-building-certifications/,GRESB announces public consultation  on building certifications,"Background Since its inception, the GRESB Standard has recognized building certifications as a valuable proxy for management and performance. High quality certifications serve as an additional layer of transparency to investors, distinguishing spaces and facilities that have received third-party recognition for sustainability efforts. In the last decade, the building certification landscape has significantly evolved and expanded, resulting in an ever-growing number of available schemes covering a wider variety of ESG topics. At the same time, the scope and significance of the GRESB Standard continue to adapt to fast-changing expectations from institutional investors. The GRESB Foundation has asked the Real Estate Standard Committee to review the current situation, including engaging with key stakeholders, collecting feedback, and potentially developing new criteria to accept and score building certifications. The GRESB Real Estate Standard The GRESB Real Estate Standard applies several evaluation criteria to recognize and score building certifications schemes. Current criteria provide a large number of schemes with full recognition and limited information to inform scoring and analysis. In response, the GRESB Foundation requests stakeholder feedback to develop new building certification evaluation criteria that will: Feedback process The feedback process offers GRESB stakeholders the opportunity to review and comment on a revised list of criteria drafted by the GRESB Foundation via a public consultation. Input will be solicited from three groups of stakeholders: Group 1: Participant Members and Industry Partners Group 2: Partners and other key stakeholders Group 3: Investor Members Each stakeholder group will be consulted over a two-week period, and the criteria will be refined and updated using feedback from each group. Investor Members will be the last group consulted in the process, offering them the opportunity to review the criteria that incorporate feedback from other groups. The final criteria will subsequently be provided to the Real Estate Standard Committee for their consideration. They may elect to accept, reject, or request revisions to the new criteria. If needed, the Real Estate Standard Committee may refer them to the Foundation Board for a final decision. Subject to changes by the committee or board, the new criteria will be published in October 2024, in an effort to be effective for the 2025 Real Estate Standard. Timeline The consultation process will last approximately ten weeks, from April-June 2024. Specific milestones are provided below: April 15: Secretariat shares the first draft criteria with Group 1. April 15-28: Consultation period opens for Group 1. May 6: Revised draft criteria shared with Group 2. May 6-19: Consultation period opens for Group 2. May 27: Revised draft criteria shared with Group 3. May 27-June 9: Consultation period opens for Group 3.

SFDR continues to be a pivotal ESG regulation for European investors and global investors with exposure to the EU. GRESB’s SFDR Reporting Solution is designed to help managers meet the most arduous part of the regulation – reporting on product-level Principal Adverse Impacts – while gaining valuable business insights. The 2024 SFDR Reporting Solution has undergone important updates aimed at improving the user experience for investors whose managers need to report on product- and entity-level ESG practices for Article 8 or 9 funds. In 2023, investors gained the ability to request access to SFDR data and reports via the GRESB Portal. Starting this year, in compliance with the latest regulatory requirements, the report will capture two years’ worth of data, will automatically prefill data from the previous year, and will include additional features to streamline reporting. Additional measures have also been implemented to further ease the reporting burden for fund managers and enable investors to better engage with their managers and use the data for their own reporting purposes. Sign up for our “Navigating Sustainable Investments with GRESB” webinar for an overview of the SFDR Reporting Solution. ESG Factors in Infrastructure We are pleased to share the release of “Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors in infrastructure,” an ESG-focused supplement to the Infrastructure Monitor, Global Infrastructure Hub (GI Hub)’s flagship publication on the state of investment in infrastructure. Developed in partnership with the GI Hub and leveraging GRESB data, the ESG supplement provides an enhanced understanding of the current state of ESG in infrastructure, spotlighting the progress made as well as identifying areas where ESG policies, practices, and disclosures require further improvement. Key findings include: ESG policies and practices improved in infrastructure assets in 2023 across all pillars, with governance showing the most progress 60% of infrastructure assets have a net-zero target, but only a third of all assets consist of a science-based target or are aligned with net-zero setting frameworks Net-zero targets tend to be location-based, focusing on Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with Europe leading in Scope 3 and market-based targeting Most infrastructure assets systematically assess the financial impact of physical climate risks, with over two-thirds identifying material impacts Transition risks are widely recognized, with policy and legal risks being the most acknowledged and likely to have a material financial impact 92% of infrastructure assets have an individual responsible for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) issues Download the ESG supplement and full report here. Foundation update Foundation members in-person meeting The Foundation Board gathered in person in London for their annual in-person meeting this month.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-launches-carbon-footprint-dashboard-equipping-investors-with-energy-consumption-and-ghg-emissions-data-for-real-estate-portfolios/,"GRESB launches Carbon Footprint Dashboard, equipping investors with energy consumption and GHG emissions data for real estate portfolios","Amsterdam, January 24, 2024 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments, announces the release of the Carbon Footprint Dashboard. This interactive tool marks a significant step in empowering GRESB’s real estate investor members with extensive insights into their portfolios’ energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Powered by asset-level data, the Carbon Footprint Dashboard offers real estate investors a comprehensive view of the energy usage and GHG emissions within their GRESB portfolios, enabling them to make informed decisions that benefit both their investments and the planet. The tool allows investors to visualize and analyze data on a country and property sector basis, filling in any data gaps through GRESB’s industry-leading estimation model. This, in turn, can also aid investors in meeting disclosure requirements. Reported energy and GHG emissions data can vary significantly across property sectors and assets, creating a critical data gap for investors worldwide in calculating their portfolio’s carbon footprint. Notably, according to GRESB data, the hotel and office sectors report the highest percentage of building-level energy consumption data across property sectors, at 89% and 85%, respectively. In contrast, the residential and retail sectors present lower figures at 61% and 52%, respectively. Consequently, investors in these sectors encounter substantial challenges in determining their portfolio’s carbon footprint due to incomplete data. GRESB’s new dashboard addresses this issue by enabling investors to accurately estimate missing data using GRESB’s Estimation Model, ensuring complete coverage across energy and GHG data and providing investors with a holistic view of their carbon footprint. GRESB’s Estimation Model uses known building data points—such as floor size, location, and property subtype—to generate highly representative estimations from a global database of over 170,000 assets within the GRESB benchmark. “GRESB is dedicated to supporting investors in their sustainability journey. The launch of the Carbon Footprint Dashboard reinforces our commitment to providing invaluable tools that drive positive environmental impact within the real estate sector,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO at GRESB. The Carbon Footprint Dashboard aligns with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) methodology, ensuring that investors can calculate their share of energy consumption and GHG emissions according to globally recognized standards.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-iwbi-announce-new-strategic-partnership/,GRESB and IWBI announce new strategic partnership,"In December 2023, GRESB and the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI) announced a strategic partnership to accelerate social sustainability by elevating reporting and disclosure capacities related to crucial social indicators, such as health, well-being, and equity. Given the fluctuating regulatory landscape, both investors and companies are increasingly driven to address social sustainability, representing the “S” in ESG. As defined by the UN Global Compact (UNGC), social sustainability is the process of identifying and managing all types of business impacts on people. Social sustainability frequently correlates with commercial opportunities and risks facing real asset investors and managers. Integrating a stronger emphasis on health, well-being, and equity within sustainability reporting will bridge the divide in existing ESG frameworks regarding social sustainability. The IWBI-GRESB partnership aims to assist investors, fund managers, and companies in advancing social sustainability by: Pioneering resources to aid investors, companies, and asset operators embed social performance into the investment engagement process Co-producing a social sustainability dashboard with performance measures utilizing data from the GRESB Real Estate Assessment Convening key stakeholders to delve into the best practices and reporting frameworks addressing the social components relevant to social sustainability Supplying accompanying materials to aid investors in leveraging information and key insights from the GRESB and IWBI social sustainability reports and tools Since 2013, the IWBI has developed the WELL Standard, the leading global framework for scaling health across buildings, organizations, and communities. Backed by more than 7,000 scientific studies, the WELL Standard outlines key building-level interventions and organizational strategies across ten categories: air, water, nourishment, light, movement, thermal comfort, sound, materials, mind, and community. In 2024, the WELL Standard is used in over 125 countries, by more than one quarter of the Fortune 500 companies, and across 4.9 billion square feet of real estate.

I am proud to lead such a critical part of GRESB and support the Foundation’s mission to drive sustainable value through effective communication between institutional investors and managers. The work that goes into ensuring a functioning GRESB Foundation requires countless hours (sometime in the middle of the night) of commitment from more than 100 individuals around the globe. I owe tremendous gratitude to the Foundation Board, the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, the Working Groups, and the Expert Resource Groups. These volunteers are the lifeblood of the Foundation. They ensure the GRESB Standards remain independent, investor-led and reflective of the real asset industry, and each of them contributed to the Foundation’s successes of 2023. Over the course of the year: We created twelve months of newsletters, countless articles and even podcasts, which reached the eyes and ears of thousands of people around the world We hosted town halls and round tables around the globe to elevate and explore the concepts that are most important to our stakeholders We continued to advance and improve the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards, keeping up with the rapidly evolving real asset industry We shared the findings from the Net Zero Working Groups, which will continue to inform next year’s Standards We elected nearly ten new members to the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees and put them straight to work crafting proposed changes to the Standards We invited several new members to the Expert Resource Group, who have already raised their hands to support our 2024 Standards development work plans We thanked Patrick Kanters for his nearly three-year tenure as the inaugural Foundation Board Chair, where he has played a critical role in ensuring the Board’s continued success After serving on several GRESB committees for more than a decade, we welcomed Katie Jowett as the new Foundation Board Chair We published the Foundation 2024 Roadmap, which will serve as the crucial communication tool between the Foundation and each of you I sincerely hope our accomplishments elevate the importance of the GRESB Foundation and reinforce its vital role in advancing sustainability within the real asset industry. I also hope it is clear to you that the Foundation does that work as an echo chamber. We rely on your input to guide and evolve the standards’ development. You elevate the topics we explore, you inform the questions we ask, and you demand the changes we make to the Standards. Your participation and support are what drives sustainable market transformation. As we embark on another year together, I commit to each of you that you will see and hear from us more, and more importantly, that we will listen and engage with you more. On behalf of the GRESB Foundation, I am grateful for each of you and to your contributions to the standards. I sincerely look forward to engaging with even more of you — GRESB’s invaluable stakeholders — in the years to come. Thank you and happy new year! Sincerely,"

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresbs-2023-in-review-progress-and-milestones/,GRESB’s 2023 in review: Progress and milestones,"2023 has been an extremely productive year at GRESB, marked by the release of important new features and continuous technical improvements to ensure that our investor members, participants, and partners can make the most of their GRESB membership and capitalize on their sustainability efforts. Among the many initiatives carried out in 2023, we are proud to share a few highlights: The GRESB Transition Risk Report underwent important updates twice in the past year: First, in March, when the report was updated with the new CRREM pathways; and more recently, in October, when the report was updated with 2023 data and new functionalities such as percentage of ownership, benchmarking insights, market-based emissions, and much more. In August, GRESB launched a much anticipated “Customize Peer Group” functionality to allow real estate participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as defined by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. The feature was released in test phase and developed in response to industry feedback. GRESB’s investor tools also underwent significant improvements in 2023, with a more user-friendly Data Exporter now featuring multiple filters and a save functionality, and an updated Portfolio Analysis Tool now allowing investors to better customize their analysis and input percentage of ownership, among other enhancements. 2024 will see further improvements and new features, so stay tuned! Additionally, as of late 2023, GRESB’s non-listed Investor Members can now request access to managers’ Transition Risk Report, TCFD Alignment Report, and SFDR Reporting Solution for additional timely insights to inform their investment decisions. Investors can also express interest in these reports to managers who have not yet purchased them. As our regional teams and global footprint continue to expand, GRESB is also creating tailored content and pathways for our regions. In 2023, we launched two new regional newsletters: “GRESB Quarterly, Americas,” and most recently “GRESB Quarterly, Oceania.” In late 2023, GRESB shared the release of a brand-new GRESB Infrastructure Development Asset Assessment to better cater to the needs of assets in the construction or pre-construction phase. The new assessment provides infrastructure assets in development with a way to accurately reflect their overall sustainability efforts using dynamic materiality. Throughout the year, the GRESB Portal saw multiple upgrades and technical enhancements. Users now enjoy a faster experience, with the Portal running twice as swiftly as it did in 2022. Moreover, we have amped up the speed of the Data Exporter and improved the GRESB Third Party validation process, enabling more granular validation while minimizing the risk of human errors. Looking ahead to 2024, GRESB investor members, participants, and partners can anticipate even more innovative improvements, timely products, and enhanced functionalities that will further assist them on their sustainability journey, empowering them to navigate ESG challenges with greater precision and effectiveness.

Best, Tom Idzal Head of Americas Measurabl on taking politics out of ESG The issue of climate change has long been a hot button topic across both sides of the political divide in the United States. Until fairly recently however, ESG had broadly managed to stay out of the same firing line. But over the past year, for businesses themselves, the politicization of ESG has created something of a bind. Firms find themselves caught between seeking to comply with investor demands and navigating a growing patchwork of statutes that seek to limit the use of ESG factors in business decisions. With new regulations frequently introduced mandating ESG targets or guarding against mandates, it’s a complex landscape. Read Measurabl’s insights into “Taking politics out of ESG” to learn more.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/investor-access-to-transition-risk-tcfd-and-sfdr-reports/,"Investor access to Transition Risk, TCFD, and SFDR reports","We are pleased to share that from today onwards non-listed investors can request access to managers’ Transition Risk Report and TCFD Alignment Report. As a reminder, non-listed investors can also request access to SFDR reports as of mid-October and to SFDR data since May. By engaging with managers on transition risk, TCFD alignment, and SDFR compliance, investors can future-proof their portfolio and receive additional timely insights to inform their investment decisions. The Transition Risk Report uses a manager’s 2023 assessment submission to generate asset- and fund-level insights into your investment’s exposure to climate-related transition risk over time, at both a country and global level. The TCFD Alignment Report also relies on the data submitted by managers as part of the assessment process to produce additional timely insights to help you stay ahead of emerging regulatory and climate disclosure requirements. The SFDR Reporting Solution helps your managers meet the most arduous part of SFDR – reporting on product-level Principal Adverse Impacts – while gaining valuable business insights. How to request access: Step-by-step instructions Checking the status of your request After submitting a request, the status of your request will show as “pending request.” You can track all your access requests in the “Pending access requests” tab. Once a request has been approved/rejected, you will be notified by email. Express interest In addition to streamlining access to these insights, this new process also enables investors to express their interest in viewing the reports to managers who may not have purchased the product(s) yet. We also launched some exciting updates to the Data Exporter and Portfolio Analysis Tool in October to increase their usability. For any questions on access to your managers’ GRESB value-added reports, please contact our Member Relations team. Interested in learning more?"

This increasing dedication and awareness of data quality demonstrates the commitment of global real assets to transparency and sustainability on a broader scale,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO at GRESB. In 2023, GRESB also increased the granularity of the information it collects on net zero, ranging from net-zero policies to commitments and targets, enabling the tracking of this data for the first time. Key real estate insights Participation in GRESB Real Estate Benchmark jumped by 15% in 2023, growing to cover 2,084 listed and non-listed portfolios representing approximately USD 7.2 trillion of GAV across 75 countries and regions. Growth was particularly strong in Oceania and Asia, while markets like Europe and the Americas continued with steady growth rates. In relative terms, Oceania stood out as the fastest-growing region, recording a sharp 23% year-over-year increase in participation. On a global scale, Europe led the pack with the highest number of new participants, rising from 907 to 1,013. At the market level, the United States recorded the highest number of new participants (up from 380 to 433), while participation in Taiwan increased by 900% year over year, growing from one entity to 10. Average GRESB scores increased by a point to 75 for the Standing Investments Benchmark and by two points to 83 in the Development Benchmark. Net-zero highlights 72% of global real estate participants have a net-zero policy in place, with 93% of participants in Oceania reporting a net-zero policy, followed by Asia and Europe with 78% and 77%, respectively. Despite most participants reporting a net-zero policy, only 56% of global participants have made a public net-zero commitment and 50% have established a net-zero target. Key infrastructure insights The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew to cover 172 funds and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment to include 687 assets across 72 countries and regions. The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers approximately USD 393 billion of GAV at the fund level and USD 1.2 trillion of GAV at the asset level for a total of approximately USD 1.6 trillion of GAV. Facilities in the Infrastructure Benchmark jumped by 15% compared to 2022, increasing from 2,481 to 2,851 across 37 sectors. In relative terms, both Oceania and the Americas displayed the steepest growth, recording 10% and 11% year-over-year increases in participation, respectively. In absolute terms, EMEA remains the most represented region in the Benchmark with more than 350 assets. At the market level, Korean assets increased again this year to include 19 entities, marking a 26% year-over-year increase. Average GRESB scores for assets jumped by four points to 83 and for funds by one point to 83. GRESB Infrastructure Members continue to deepen their data coverage, with an increasing number of participants now reporting on key metrics such as Air Pollution, Biodiversity & Habitat, Waste and Employees engagement. Net-zero highlights 60% of global infrastructure assets reported a net-zero policy in 2023, with Oceania and Europe leading the way with 65% of participants in both regions having a net-zero policy in place. While only 40% of global assets reported net-zero commitments, 60% have already set net-zero targets. At the fund level, 68% of reporting funds have a net-zero policy in place, while 70% have already shared net-zero commitments and 60% set net-zero targets. “Net zero in real assets is not merely a goal, but a necessity. It requires a collective commitment to reduce carbon footprints and drive sustainability in the built environment. GRESB participants stand at the forefront of this movement, actively implementing strategies, setting targets and integrating sustainable practices to accelerate progress towards a net-zero future,” said Roussotte.

Furthermore, the GRESB Foundation appreciates IFRS’ recognition for the core elements of GRESB’s approach to science-based standards development. Since the new IFRS standards define materiality solely in reference to financial investors, the new S1 and S2 standards will need to be used in coordination with more holistic reporting frameworks, such as GRI and GRESB. To that end, GRESB expects there will be significant overlap between the SASB-based IFRS S1 and S2 standards, given the high alignment with the SASB standard, as well as its real estate indicator objectives/scopes.For more information on the existing GRESB alignments, please review how GRESB aligns with common ESG reporting frameworks.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-ifrs-standards-represent-a-milestone-for-sustainability-disclosure/,New IFRS standards represent a milestone for sustainability disclosure,"This week marked an ESG milestone with the release of the IFRS sustainability disclosure standards. The notion of IFRS S1 and S2 may not immediately spark excitement. However, they are a Big Deal. Their release is the culmination of an intensive, 18-month development process and the consolidation of multiple underlying standards. S1 is envisioned as a “global baseline” for sustainability disclosure — focusing on information that can be “reasonably foreseen” to be relevant to investment decisions. S1 builds on SASB with guidance for industry-specific disclosures. S2 is used in coordination with S1 to focus on climate-related disclosures. S2 fully incorporates and extends TCFD recommendations. It requires industry-specific, material information about climate-related risks and opportunities, including both physical and transition risks. IFRS standards are explicitly designed to integrate with corporate financial statements — matching entities, time periods, accounting assumptions, and other key factors. They emphasize the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on current and anticipated future performance, financial position, and cash flows. Speaking in London at the 2023 IFRS Conference, ISSB Chair Emmanuel Faber said that the new standards provide a consistent, comprehensive language for reporting — one that will be familiar to users of IASB protocols in 140 countries. Faber emphasized that the new standard expands the scope of financial reporting across the value chain. He also articulated three criteria for standards moving forward. According to Faber, standards should be: Equitable Accessible Iterative It is validating to hear that GRESB’s approach to standard development reflects Faber’s criteria: GRESB standards are open and available to all GRESB governance process is transparent and accessible to all stakeholders through the non-profit, industry-led GRESB Foundation GRESB standard development is iterative — adapting and improving every year to meet the changing needs and circumstances of the market GRESB applauds the new IFRS standards, and it appreciates recognition for the core elements of GRESB’s approach to science-based standards development. To this end, GRESB has conducted a series of framework mapping exercises, looking at how the GRESB Standards align with common ESG frameworks and evaluating alignment with nine different standards. The resulting crosswalks can be explored and downloaded here. Particularly relevant to the new IFRS standards, a recent analysis of the SASB standards found high alignment with GRESB, with nearly 80% of SASB’s RE indicator objectives/scopes and underlying content addressed by GRESB. Significant alignment was also found between GRESB Standards and SASB’s Standard, with an overall alignment of nearly 70% (download the alignment review). We expect similar alignment with the new SASB-based IFRS S1 and S2 standards. It is notable that the new IFRS standards remain unapologetically focused on single materiality. This means that their definition of materiality is defined explicitly with respect to financial materiality as defined by IFRS’ concept of “relevance to investors.” This structure was inherited from SASB and it presumes that investors are narrowly focused on balance sheet issues with secondary or tertiary concern about the impacts of running the business. The standards do not require disclosure related to broader social and environmental impacts. This strategy may not align with regional regulatory regimes and it has well documented limitations for issues such as public health. IFRS recognizes that this means that the new S1 and S2 standards will need to be used in coordination with more holistic reporting frameworks, such as GRI and GRESB. Going forward, we celebrate this important milestone, and we recognize its importance in advancing sustainability reporting. We are excited to explore ways to leverage the new standards as we pursue our shared mission of providing timely, relevant, and material information to market participants. Onward!

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/june-newsletter-new-peer-group-selection-functionality-global-results-event-regional-insights-events/,June Newsletter: New peer group selection functionality; Global Results Event & Regional Insights events,"The GRESB Assessments deadline is only a few days away! Please remember to submit your Assessment response before the Portal closes on July 1, 2023. For any questions on the Assessments or for assistance, please contact us. To learn more about what you can expect in the coming weeks and months, please refer to our GRESB Assessment timeline. In the meantime, we have two important updates on a new peer group selection functionality currently being developed and our 2023 results events below. New “Customize Peer Group” functionality Starting August 1, 2023, GRESB real estate participants will have access to a brand new “Customize Peer Group” functionality in the GRESB Portal. This new feature, available in 2023 in test phase, is being developed in response to industry feedback and allows participants to either confirm their predefined peer group, as allocated by GRESB, or submit edits to the peer grouping criteria. Because this functionality is still being developed, your updated peer group selection will not appear in your 2023 Benchmark Report. However, your input will allow us to build the functionality in a way that accounts for as many real-life use cases as possible. In October, as a gesture of appreciation for your input, you will be able to access your ranking against your Customized Peer Group in the GRESB Portal. The ranking will be available to participants only. Participants will also be able to provide feedback on the usability of the functionality, which will be critical to improving the functionality for its 2024 release, when it will also appear in the Benchmark Reports. Available between August 1 and August 30, the “Customize Peer Group” process takes less than five minutes to complete and comprises only a few simple steps. Learn more about it here. 2023 GRESB events The 2023 GRESB Results events series is right around the corner!

The link between GRESB participation & financial performance As sustainability continues to gain prominence in the real estate industry, investors and fund managers are increasingly recognizing the potential impact of ESG practices on financial performance. Leveraging two recent studies, we shed light on the interplay between GRESB participation and non-listed real estate fund returns in Europe and in the US. Read key findings. Foundation update Introduction to new GRESB staff Chris Pyke and Sarah Welton recently joined the GRESB team and have begun supporting the work of the Foundation Board. Chris is returning to GRESB as the Chief Innovation Officer and he will lead GRESB’s innovation strategy across all aspects of the organization. Sarah will serve as the Foundation and Stakeholder Engagement Director and will act as the key interface between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV. CRREM In September 2022, GRESB released the preliminary 2022 GRESB Real Estate Benchmark Reports, including a new “Portfolio Decarbonization” section, showing a portfolio’s performance against the CRREM pathways. In response to this new section, the Foundation solicited feedback from global industry organizations, including PCA, Nareit, ULI, REALPAC, and ANREV, to request their input on the updated section in the Benchmark Reports. The feedback was reviewed by the Foundation Board during the May Foundation Board meeting and, as a result, an updated CRREM section will be included as part of the 2023 Real Estate Benchmark Report and an updated version of the 2022 CRREM section will also be released in the coming weeks. The two most notable changes to the 2022 re-release are the removal of “stranding year” terminology and updated “limitations” language. 2024 Standards review In its most recent meeting, the Foundation Board continued its review of the proposed changes to the 2024 Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards, scheduled for release in late October. There are several topics being considered by the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, all of which will be presented to the Foundation Board for final approval. The real estate topics include residential real estate, energy consumption and performance, building certifications, TCFD alignment, physical climate risk and transition risk. The infrastructure topics include a solution for infrastructure under development, TCFD alignment, and GHG performance. It should be noted that the topics of net zero, embodied carbon, and biodiversity are already in progress (please refer to the May 2023 update for more details) and diversity, equity and inclusion will likely be prioritized after the 2024 Standards are released.

Foundation update TCFD alignment on climate-related opportunities Earlier this month, the GRESB Foundation Board approved the first changes for the 2024 Infrastructure Standards, including the alignment of Physical Climate Risks (PCR) and Transition Risks (TR) with TCFD-related indicators. These updates had been previously endorsed by the Infrastructure Standards Committee and include changes to better integrate climate-related opportunities into the Standards to align more closely with the TCFD framework. This includes an update to an existing indicator, two new indicators, and the introduction of scoring across three indicators. Total scoring in the risk management section will remain unchanged, and the total points will be reassigned across indicators.

Total scoring in the risk management section will remain unchanged, and the total points will be reassigned across indicators. Embodied carbon The GRESB Foundation has approved a new indicator on embodied carbon for the 2023 Real Estate Standard. This change will encourage the collection of embodied carbon data as part of carbon accounting and commitments. Embodied carbon emissions data will be collected from New Construction assets and Major Renovation projects separately, alongside the life cycle stages and building layers included in the entity’s embodied carbon analysis for assets/projects completed during the reporting year. For more information, read our recent GRESB Insights article on what is embodied carbon in the real estate sector and why does it matter. Biodiversity Biodiversity has been deemed an issue of importance by both Standards Committees, but it was also recognized that the issue is not as mature as other topics, and therefore not as high a priority as Net Zero, DEI, and Physical Climate Risk. As further context, the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) was launched in 2022 with an initial version under consultation at the moment and a planned publication of its final recommendations in Q4 2023. It is anticipated that this framework will be adopted by several investors and managers in the future, although the framework is still a work in progress and the practicalities of its implementation are still to be defined. In terms of timing, it means that the earliest reporting year when biodiversity could be incorporated further in the Standards would be the 2025 GRESB reporting cycle. GRESB has engaged an independent consultant to help the Standards Committees evaluate and measure the significance of biodiversity on real estate and infrastructure. A literature review is underway and stakeholder interviews will begin in the coming weeks. Net Zero Working GroupsThe Net Zero Working Groups for real estate and infrastructure have successfully concluded their research and delivered their outputs to the GRESB BV team secretariat. The Real Estate Net Zero Working Group provided a technical examination of different approaches to the assessment of critical net-zero elements, including energy performance, GHG accounting, offsets, lifecycle stages, and data availability. The Infrastructure Net Zero Working Group provided an evaluation of how industry-leading frameworks address various aspects of net zero, including the treatment of Scope 3 emissions, offsets, target-setting, governance, and disclosure.The deliverables have also been shared with the Standards Committees, who will use them to inform the integration of net zero into the GRESB Standards.

Tom IdzalGRESB Head of Americas Financing commercial real estate’s net-zero transition with green bonds Focusing on commercial real estate (CRE) decarbonization initiatives, GRESB Global Partner Verdani Partners explores the current green bond landscape and its potential to help finance the net-zero transition. It also discusses the implications of new climate policies like the Inflation Reduction Act and challenges green financing must overcome to maximize positive environmental impact. Key Takeaways: Green bonds have become increasingly attractive for both issuers (i.e., companies) seeking financing for environmental projects and investors seeking to align portfolios with ESG goals. There are three major green bond reporting frameworks or standards: the Green Bond Principles, the Climate Bonds Standard, and the newly agreed upon European Green Bond Standard (currently in development). Commercial real estate companies are well suited to identify climate-focused projects for green bond issuance because many are already centering decarbonization and climate risk management across operations and long-term strategy. The unprecedented level of climate funding offered by the Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to shift demand for climate-focused green bonds. Greenwashing and additionality are two key challenges facing the green bond market. Read the full article here.

This year’s initiative will focus on encouraging listed real estate companies and REITs to make ESG disclosures in line with the GRESB Standards via participation in the annual GRESB benchmarks. This deepening focus on standardized ESG disclosures and comparable ESG scores is reflected in the most recent end-of-year survey of global GRESB investor members, which found that 70% of those surveyed believe GRESB will be the platform that investees will use to report on their TCFD alignment and related disclosures, in addition to their core ESG management practices and performance. TCFD is becoming increasingly relevant in Asia as more regulatory bodies align their disclosures to the global frameworks. By engaging through GRESB – the common language for ESG disclosures across the globe – investors have a consistent lens through which to track climate-related disclosures and risk management practices over time and to drive improvements where needed. The 2023 collaborative effort is driven by 18 institutional investors representing USD 8.1 trillion of assets under management, including: Aegon AM B&I Capital Bouwinvest Brookfield CenterSquare Cohen & Steers Columbia Threadneedle DWS Heitman JP Morgan Kempen Northern Trust MFS IM Principal Financial Group Quay Global Investors Resolution Capital Schroders Vert Asset Management The GRESB Standards cover the most material ESG issues for real asset investments, as defined by industry stakeholders. The Standards align with other global ESG reporting frameworks, including GRI, SASB, CDP, and the TCFD recommendations. “Sustainability considerations are increasingly important in managing risks and creating value in real estate portfolios. GRESB participation provides stakeholders important insights on how management teams are addressing these factors and positioning real estate portfolios for the future.” – Michael Shoemacher Director, Real Estate Securities, Brookfield. About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated ESG data to financial markets. Established in 2009, GRESB has become the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world, used by 170 institutional and financial investors to inform decision-making.

Call for nominations to the GRESB Foundation Standards CommitteesThe GRESB Foundation is seeking new candidates to serve on its Standards Committees for both the real estate and infrastructure industries. In response to high interest from the GRESB community, the Foundation Board has decided to accept and review nominations on an ongoing basis for each Committee, and appoint new members as and when vacancies become available. At present, there are several vacancies in both Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, and the Foundation Board is aiming to start selecting candidates by early May 2023, so please send your application as soon as possible to be considered for this next round of nominations. You can apply by completing this Nomination Form. More information on the call for nominations and the responsibilities of being a Standards Committee member can be found on our website. Shaping the 2024 GRESB StandardsRecent discussions with Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees have focused on planning and developing content to shape the 2024 Standards, as well as looking further ahead to prioritize research for longer-term developments. The main issues discussed for real estate include residential real estate, building certifications, and energy performance, while infrastructure discussions have focused on assets in development as well as closer alignment to TCFD through the integration of climate-related opportunities. Development of the approach to and inclusion of net zero across all Standards, currently in focus through the ongoing Net Zero Working Groups, continues to be a top priority for both committees and will be the focus of upcoming meetings in May. Over the coming months, the Foundation will continue to review, research, and implement plans on a number of these topics in order to finalize content for the 2024 Standards changes. Net Zero Working GroupsThe Net Zero Working Groups for real estate and infrastructure have successfully conducted their first two (out of three) working group sessions, during which topic-focused workstreams within each Working Group have presented and discussed the outcomes and progress of their research. The Working Groups are currently in the process of drafting their respective output documents, which are set to be presented to the corresponding Standards Committees next month. The Real Estate Net Zero Working Group will provide a ledger of the pros and cons of different approaches to net-zero assessment within the industry. The Infrastructure Net Zero Working Group will provide an evaluation of the extent to which various aspects of net zero are addressed in industry-leading frameworks. GRESB eagerly anticipates the final output of the Working Groups, which the respective Standards Committees will review and assess during their meeting in May. The Standards Committees will use these outputs to inform the integration of net zero into the GRESB Standards, which is expected to contribute significantly towards providing clear and contextualized information to the financial industry regarding the net-zero journeys of real assets in the GRESB universe.

Foundation update Standards Strategic RoadmapSince the publication of the 2023 GRESB Standards changes in October 2022, the GRESB Foundation has continued its work, in line with the new operating model, to review key strategic ESG topics in the GRESB vision, assess main industry challenges, and prioritize topics and action plans for the Standards Strategic Roadmap.The Strategic Roadmap will provide more transparency on the outcome of the Foundation work and prioritization exercise, as well as more visibility into the proposed direction of travel for the GRESB Standards. The Foundation aims to finalize a first version of the roadmap and share it in the near future.Stakeholder engagementThe Foundation also plans to enhance stakeholder engagement and leverage the collective expertise of the GRESB community to help drive the evolution of the Standards. To do this, the Foundation, with the support of GRESB BV, will organize a variety of stakeholder engagements in the coming months, including working groups, consultations, surveys, and more.Net zero has already been recognized by the Foundation as a top priority, and two Net Zero Working Groups, with a focus on real estate and infrastructure, respectively, are currently working on questions that will be presented to the Standards Committees in May 2023. The Foundation may also commission Working Groups on other priority topics, such as Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion or Physical Climate Risk Assessments.Shaping the 2024 GRESB StandardsAs part of its work in the past few months, the Foundation has identified several more pressing issues that should be the primary focus of the work this year, either to be reflected in the 2024 Standards, or to be researched, specified, and planned in order to facilitate future implementation in the GRESB Standards.In this context, GRESB BV, as instructed by the Foundation, is now focusing on the research and deliverables required to support this shorter-term work. Over the next six months, the Foundation will predominantly focus on reviewing the proposed approaches for the short-term Standards changes and finalize the decisions on the 2024 Standards changes in September.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/pcaf-crrem-and-gresb-release-first-version-of-technical-guidance-for-accounting-and-reporting-of-ghg-emissions-from-real-estate-operations/,"PCAF, CRREM and GRESB release first version of technical guidance for “Accounting and Reporting of GHG Emissions from Real Estate Operations”","The jointly developed technical guidance by PCAF, CRREM and GRESB for the accounting and reporting of real estate-related operational emissions has been released today. Cannes, France, 14 March 2023: After intensive public consultation, PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials), CRREM (Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor) and GRESB have collaborated to release the harmonized technical guidance for the financial industry on “Accounting and Reporting of GHG emissions from Real Estate Operations.” Since decarbonization, transition risk, net-zero target setting as well as GHG accounting and reporting are becoming increasingly important for the real estate sector, a clear guidance on standardized and harmonized accounting procedures related to all aspects of carbon and other GHG emissions is urgently required. The new technical guidance offers this additional clarification and serves as a best practice document with additional specifications to PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry on a range of technical, data and standards issues relating to operational GHG emissions from real estate. This guidance can be used by financial institutions (banks and investors) and, insofar as they require standardized information, their underlying real estate assets, asset managers and companies. In the guidance, the three collaborating organizations clearly set out their recommendations for accounting procedures for both investors and banks, direct and indirect investments, equity and debt, full ownership and joint partnerships, under a variety of consolidation approaches. Main clarifications and key recommendations included in this paper are: Differentiation between corporate GHG accounting and accounting of financed emissionsDifferentiation between GHG accounting for reporting and for other purposes (e.g. transition risk management)Clear definitions for GHG emissions from real estate and differentiation of various categories, including a review of operational carbon vs. embodied carbon in the real estate sectorApplication of the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard and PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry for real estate, including clarifications on applications related to “Leased Assets” and “Financed emissions” (Scope 3 Cat 13 and 15) Application and clarification on “Operational Control” consolidation approachApplication relationship to TCFDThe importance of capturing all relevant emissions via the whole-building approach Clarification on emissions scope delineation and attribution for various financial actors and boundaries between tenant and landlord emissionsRecommendations for the application of market- and location-based emissions methods, estimation of incomplete data, handling of energy flux measurement, floor space measurement and quality assurance and verification We invite all market participants to apply the new technical guidance and participate in its future development. The document can be accessed here. You can also register to attend a webinar and discussion on the guidance, taking place April 25 at 10:00 CET. About PCAF The Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) is a global, industry-led initiative of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with loans and investments, known as financed emissions. As of February 2023, over 360 financial institutions have committed to the initiative. In November 2020, PCAF published the first-ever Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Financial Industry, which covers the financed emissions of loans and investments in commercial real estate, mortgages, and various other asset classes. PCAF collaborates with several organizations, institutions, and coalitions, including CDP, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA). Contact: [email protected] About CRREM The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) initiative has derived decarbonization pathways that translate the ambitions of the Paris Agreement (to limit global warming to 1.5°C by the end of the century) into regionally- and property-type-specific trajectories against which real estate assets and portfolios can benchmark themselves. The pathways and the developed free-ware tool can be used to derive quantitative figures regarding “transition risk” (in this case, the risk of assets being stranded due to regulatory incompliance or market obsolescence). The non-for-profit-initiative is supported by the EU commission, Laudes Foundation as well as APG, PGGM, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM).

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2022-investor-member-survey-findings/,2022 GRESB Investor Member Survey Findings,"In Q4 2022, GRESB conducted an Investor Member Survey to explore how investors use GRESB data and how they engage with their managers and portfolio companies. See the survey results and takeaways below. Key Findings A significant majority (75%) of surveyed investor members report actively engaging with their managers to request participation in the annual GRESB assessments, with approximately one-third of investor members requiring mandatory participation.All survey respondents report having a responsible investment strategy in place, with ESG integration and corporate engagement and shareholder action emerging as the most commonly used approaches.Around two-thirds of surveyed investor members use GRESB results and benchmarks as an engagement tool with their managers, and almost half of respondents use the data to analyze the environmental footprint of their overall portfolio.The vast majority of respondents believe that GRESB will be the platform of choice for managers to report on climate-related financial disclosures and transition risk data. Participation The survey features responses from 42% of the GRESB investor member base, for a total of 61 respondents. The majority of respondents represent investor members with access to the real estate dataset and with headquarters in EMEA. Responsible Investment Strategy All survey respondents report having a responsible investment strategy in place, with ESG integration and corporate engagement and shareholder action emerging as the most commonly used approaches. The majority of respondents also believe that insight gained from GRESB helps them achieve their responsible investment goals. GRESB Portfolio Coverage The survey shows that GRESB portfolio coverage for investor members is comparatively higher for real estate than it is for infrastructure. Engagement with Managers The survey largely demonstrates a high level of engagement between investors and managers, with 75% of investor members actively engaging with their managers to request participation in the annual GRESB assessments. Of these, 53% encourage voluntary participation and 44% incorporate mandatory participation in their agreements. Of those who make participation mandatory, the majority also sets specific targets regarding the GRESB performance of their investments. The majority of investors feel that they receive enough support from GRESB to increase participation across their portfolio. The survey also reveals that the most common challenges identified by managers regarding their GRESB participation are tied to managers’ resource constraints and costs. GRESB Membership Most investors report joining GRESB because of the alignment of the framework with their responsible investment principles and because it helps them engage with their managers. Specifically, GRESB results and benchmarks help investors understand where their investments stand and monitor how managers are managing ESG risks, opportunities, and impact. The survey also highlights that access to peer benchmarking information distinguishes GRESB from other benchmarking platforms, according to 59% of respondents. In addition, 36% of respondents also find that industry endorsement distinguishes GRESB from other benchmarking platforms. Investor Member Tools Out of all investor member tools and core products, respondents rated the Benchmark Report the highest, with the Portfolio Analysis Tool (PAT) and the Data Exporter receiving a rating 0.4 points lower than the Benchmark Report. The most frequent feedback received from respondents regarding the PAT is that it is most insightful when investors’ portfolio coverage is sufficiently high. Additionally, the potential reason why the average rating for the investor member tools is neither particularly high nor low could be attributed to the fact that many respondents indicated that they don’t use all of the tools. New Products: TCFD and Transition Risk The vast majority of respondents believe that GRESB will be the platform of choice for managers to report on climate-related financial disclosures and transition risk data, with respondents in the Americas largely endorsing the TCFD Alignment Report and the Transition Risk Report. On SFDR (the EU’s Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation), survey respondents highlighted general uncertainty on the degree that GRESB will be the platform to report on product-level Principal Adverse Impacts. This may become more clear now that the first reporting year has started. Learn more about becoming a GRESB member"

For many asset managers, the main challenge will be to report on detailed product-level ESG characteristics, specifically Principal Adverse Impacts (PAIs).The GRESB SFDR Reporting Solution, available for both real estate and infrastructure, can help you comply with the regulation by helping you collect more accurate PAI statements from the very start, future-proofing your reporting.Real estate managers missing critical energy and GHG data can also take advantage of the GRESB Estimation Model (GEM) to get highly accurate estimations based on real data in the GRESB database.Ready to get started with SFDR reporting?

GRESB’s first Net Zero Working Groups​​The GRESB Foundation will soon form the first GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Net Zero Working Groups. We will be accepting applications until January 26. So far, we have received great interest from the GRESB community and we thank all of those who have applied or reached out. More information about the scope, timeline, expected outputs, and how to apply, can be found on our website. The GRESB Foundation has recognized net zero as the number one priority ESG topic that needs to be further addressed and scored in the GRESB Standards, making it a key area of focus for 2023. The establishment of Net Zero Working Groups in Q1 2023 is the first engagement GRESB will conduct as part of a broader series of stakeholder engagements throughout the year on this topic. How GRESB aligns with common ESG reporting frameworksThe GRESB Foundation would like to thank the GRESB Partners who contributed to the annual alignment analysis between GRESB Standards and other prominent ESG reporting frameworks. This year, the analysis covered reporting tools from CDP, GRI, SASB, as well as the UN PRI. Assessments are based on the independently owned and governed GRESB Standards, which are reviewed on an annual basis by the GRESB Foundation. This ensures that material ESG issues are addressed and covered by the GRESB Assessments as they develop and emerge. Part of this process is reviewing and mapping other important frameworks and standards to understand where and how the GRESB Standards may align. This annual alignment review may inform prioritization of ESG issues that are considered in the GRESB Standards as well as the approach taken for the technical implementation of any proposed changes. Find out more about the alignment exercise and our partners by visiting our website.

This will start with the establishment of Net Zero Working Groups in Q1 2023. The first set of Net Zero Working Groups will focus on reviewing the various perspectives relating to net zero in order to facilitate convergence towards a definition for the GRESB Standards and to explore the core assumptions and beliefs that drive divergence in what net zero means and what constitutes a valid journey to achieve it.

This past year marked many important milestones for the GRESB community, including: The GRESB Benchmarks grew significantly in 2022, and average scores increased across the board for both real estate and infrastructure. We launched three new resources that can help you on your sustainability journey: The SFDR Reporting Solution, the Transition Risk Report, and the TCFD Alignment Report. This year also marked significant technical improvements to the GRESB Portal to ensure a smoother Portal experience for our members, partners, and participants. The GRESB Foundation established a new Standards Development Process to evolve the GRESB Standards going forward and published the changes to the 2023 Standards in October. We hope you are using this time in December to reflect on what you have accomplished and to set yourself up for success for 2023 by making any preparations that you can early, such as starting the contract renewal process before the end of the year to take advantage of discounted pricing now. Earlier this month, GRESB announced the acquisition of Asset Resolution, an asset-based climate data and analytics provider for financial institutions. The acquisition will expand and enrich GRESB’s asset-level data coverage across hard-to-abate sectors, strengthening its assessments and tools while providing GRESB members with more actionable insights and support with asset-driven analysis.

GRESB Foundation end of year meetings The GRESB Foundation Board and the GRESB BV Supervisory Board held their first annual consultation meeting on November 29, 2022, in accordance with the service-level agreement between GRESB BV and the GRESB Foundation. These meetings discuss the collaboration between both parties in meeting their respective and mutual responsibilities. Agenda points included outcomes of the GRESB Foundation annual self-evaluation process, highlights from the 2022 GRESB results, as well as the 2023 plan for the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV. The GRESB Foundation Standards Committees (SCs) also met in early December to discuss the 2023 priorities and plan, including engagement opportunities with stakeholders. The Foundation secretariat is currently working on adjusting the 2023 plan based on the feedback received from the SCs so that it can be shared with GRESB stakeholders in the new year. GRESB Foundation and the CRREM V2 pathways The CRREM decarbonization pathways are being updated and CRREM recently held a public consultation period to collect feedback. In response to high interest from the Foundation members and GRESB stakeholders on the real estate side, the GRESB Foundation facilitated an information session where CRREM’s managing director, Prof. Dr. Sven Bienert, presented the updated CRREM decarbonization pathways to the GRESB Foundation Board and Real Estate Standards Committee members, who then had the opportunity to provide direct feedback and ask questions. The updated CRREM pathways are expected to be released early next year and GRESB intends to update the Real Estate Benchmark Reports using the updated pathways in Q1 2023.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-foundation-update-events-november-2022-qa/,GRESB Foundation Update Events November 2022 – Q&A,"On November 29 & 30, GRESB hosted two GRESB Foundation Update & 2023 Standards Changes events online. Both events were well-attended and provided a forum for GRESB members and the wider real assets industry to discuss the 2023 Standards changes in detail. Below we share the most salient questions and answers from the events, as well as responses to the questions we were not able to address during the events due to time constraints.You can find more information on the 2023 GRESB Standards changes and related resources here. GRESB Foundation & Standards Is there a start date for when the Working Groups will begin to meet? Pending approval of the 2023 Foundation work plan, the Foundation will establish several Working Groups in 2023. Some of these Working Groups will start operating early in 2023, with the aim to help inform the prioritization phase of the Standards Development process, in which the key topics to be addressed and scored in the 2024 GRESB Standards are identified. Other Working groups may start later in the year and will address topics to be covered by the GRESB Standards on a medium and/or longer term. Announcements regarding the recruitment of Working Group members will be shared soon. Do you plan to have more substantial changes in the years to come? When will these changes be communicated? The GRESB Standards will continue evolving on an annual cycle. However, going forward, the approach will be twofold and split into two interrelated workstreams: Work on the changes for the coming year Work on the strategic direction of the GRESB Standards in the medium and long term. Both workstreams will be based on stakeholder consultation to not only provide an opportunity to input or feedback, but to also allow more visibility and ability to anticipate the changes. The plan is to publish changes to the GRESB Standards early in Q4 of the year preceding their implementation. The medium and long-term strategic priorities will be published in Q1 of each year. When will the 2023 guidance documents be released (Reference Guide and Scoring Document)? GRESB plans to release the 2023 guidance documents early in Q1 2023. Contrary to previous years, the Scoring Document will be released together with the Reference Guide. Is GRESB planning to move to assessing intensities in the future? Moving towards a better recognition of performance is one of the top priorities for GRESB over the next couple of years. This transition to real performance assessment will begin with the start of scoring intensities in the future. Will GRESB further integrate biodiversity issues after 2023? Foundation however recognizes that this issue will need to be closely monitored, in light of the current major developments such as the adoption of the new UN Convention on Biological Diversity in December 2022 and how it will frame ESG reporting. As such, the Foundation will continue monitoring the work of the market-led, science based Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and consider the most relevant framework to GRESB stakeholders, with the intention to align the GRESB Standards biodiversity disclosures. Will GRESB include if entities are compliant with the EU taxonomy? Addressing the role of taxonomy compliance in the GRESB Standards has not been an issue that is currently prioritized for review by the GRESB Foundation. The GRESB vision published earlier this year however includes the principle of aligning with, and seeking to influence, relevant frameworks, such as regulatory requirements, and widely adopted reporting standards. Alignment with industry and regulatory frameworks and consideration to sector and regional differences is thus part of the Standards development process and a consideration for any change considered to the standards. What is considered an acceptable net zero policy by GRESB? The GRESB Foundation deemed the existence of Net Zero policy an important element of this update, without imposing a single definition of Net Zero. As with other policies in the Standards, this change does not assess the content of the policy but instead rewards the internal commitment to Net Zero shown by establishing a policy. The provided evidence must demonstrate the existence of formal policy document(s) that address(es) net zero and not simply a list of general goals and/or commitments. Overall, all requirements outlined for the other policy indicators need to be met for the evidence for the Net Zero policy as well. The Net Zero policy does not need to be a standalone document but needs to be at least a separate, clearly distinguished section within a larger policy document. Will the scored climate risk questions require supporting documentation? In 2023, GRESB will start scoring climate risk indicators. In addition, as of 2023 the upload of evidence to support the existence of risk identification and impact assessment processes will be mandatory. Explanations in the open text boxes provided in the indicators are not sufficient but it is required to upload documents or URLs leading to pages explaining the risk identification and impact assessment processes. Further details about the evidence can be added in the specific open text boxes underneath the evidence upload. What evidence will be accepted by GRESB for the Transition Risk indicators? Participants need to provide evidence showing the existence of a formal risk identification and/or impact assessment process. The evidence needs to specifically address each transition risk issue selected (Policy & legal, Technology, Market, and Reputation). Examples of appropriate evidence include, but are not limited to: A document describing the entity’s transition risk assessments or other tangible proof of the entity’s risk assessment activity. Acceptable evidence may include an extract of a procedure undertaken such as register or matrix, checklists, scenario analysis, or a section of a risk management plan addressing transition risks. One-off assessments of transition risk, such as the GRESB Transition Risk Report, can be used as evidence only in combination with further proof of a formal process but for both indicators on risk identification and impact assessment. Please note that the GRESB Transition Risk Report would only enable participants to select the issue “Policy & legal.” The certification of buildings is not sufficient to support the existence of a risk management process. Can you clarify why a lot of the Net Zero additions are simply addressed and not scored? GRESB introduces new topics, such as Net Zero, in the Standards without scoring them in the first year to not cause significant disruptions within the benchmarks and to keep year-on-year comparability as high as possible. Furthermore, not scoring issues/indicators in the first year allows the industry to familiarize itself with the new topics and requirements before factoring it into the Assessment scores. Will GRESB take into account the different national standards when it comes to the gathering of data on waste, electricity, etc.? Local differences are taken into account by GRESB’s peer benchmarking approach. Peer groups are created based on multiple characteristics, including the location of the fund’s assets. By taking the location into account, regional differences are considered in the Assessment. In case local regulation limits data collection for participants, they are not penalized compared to their peers as all are subject to the same local regulation. How will GRESB’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) standard address country nuances in terms of racial diversity (or the absence thereof by nature of overall demographics)? DEI is one of the topics identified as top priority by the GRESB Foundation and one of the new working groups starting next year will discuss this issue and its implementation in the GRESB Standard in more detail. Regional differences and the accounting of them will be part of this discussion. For now, the GRESB Peer Group benchmarking approach will provide comparable results to all participants taking into account the location. What does it mean for an asset to be “exposed”? When an asset is exposed, is the whole fund consequently also exposed? How are you going to rate this? In the context of the GRESB Assessments, “exposure to physical risk factors” refers to the situation in which an asset is located in a spot at which a specific physical risk factor (e.g., flood, hurricane, drought) is expected or modeled to occur. This may differ from the financial definition of “exposure.” So, while an asset may be exposed to droughts, for example, the financial exposure could be very low if the asset has excellent water reuse systems in place. As described in materials provided, identified exposure to particular physical risk factors is not rated/scored in the Assessments. Rather, only that the entity has a systematic procedure for identifying exposures to physical risk factors. Quantified absolute measurement of physical climate risk is a highly complex topic for which we have not yet specified a methodology. However, physical climate risk is a prioritized topic by the GRESB Foundation and will be addressed by one of the working groups set up for next year. What are the requirements for “Dedicated employee(s) for whom DEI is a core responsibility”? To be eligible to report a dedicated employee for whom DEI is a core responsibility, this person must have work tasks specifically related to DEI. It is not required that this person has a specific DEI-related job title as long as DEI is part of the core responsibilities of the employee. Pending approval of the 2023 Foundation work plan, the Foundation will establish several Working Groups in 2023. Some of these Working Groups will start operating early in 2023, with the aim to help inform the prioritization phase of the Standards Development process, in which the key topics to be addressed and scored in the 2024 GRESB Standards are identified. Other Working groups may start later in the year and will address topics to be covered by the GRESB Standards on a medium and/or longer term. Announcements regarding the recruitment of Working Group members will be shared soon. The GRESB Standards will continue evolving on an annual cycle. However, going forward, the approach will be twofold and split into two interrelated workstreams: Work on the changes for the coming year Work on the strategic direction of the GRESB Standards in the medium and long term. Both workstreams will be based on stakeholder consultation to not only provide an opportunity to input or feedback, but to also allow more visibility and ability to anticipate the changes. The plan is to publish changes to the GRESB Standards early in Q4 of the year preceding their implementation. The medium and long-term strategic priorities will be published in Q1 of each year. GRESB plans to release the 2023 guidance documents early in Q1 2023. Contrary to previous years, the Scoring Document will be released together with the Reference Guide. Moving towards a better recognition of performance is one of the top priorities for GRESB over the next couple of years. This transition to real performance assessment will begin with the start of scoring intensities in the future.

It is not required that this person has a specific DEI-related job title as long as DEI is part of the core responsibilities of the employee. Infrastructure How will GRESB take into account the impact of assets in addition to their performance? GRESB currently enables infrastructure assets to report on social value in the indicator “Output and impact.” There are currently no widely established frameworks to measure impact, which is why this is not currently a scoring metric in the Asset Performance Component. We are initially moving to better measuring and rewarding performance and will look at further including impact following that. With regard to the Infrastructure Asset Assessment, the GRESB List of Changes says that “The overall scoring weight of GH1 remains the same. Participants who report a Net Zero target will receive 20% of the maximum score for GH1. The overall score is dependent on materiality. This score is reweighted by removing 10% of the total available for the indicator from both ‘Reporting-year target’ and ‘Future-year target’.” Is this going to apply to participants whose primary sector is “Renewable Power”? Yes, assets who fall under the “Renewable Power” sector will also be subject to the scoring changes. For these assets, it means that 60% of the available points for GH1 are awarded for completing data for the metric “Emissions avoided: Reporting-year performance,” 10% for “Emissions avoided: Reporting-year target,” 10% for “Emissions avoided: Future-year target,” and 20% for answering and completing the mandatory information for the sub-question: “Does the entity have a GHG emissions reduction target aligned with Net Zero?”. Note that if you select yes, you will need to provide baseline and end years and indicate to which scope the net zero target applies.

Note that if you select yes, you will need to provide baseline and end years and indicate to which scope the net zero target applies. Real Estate Will GRESB include embodied carbon as an issue for operational buildings? GRESB is already addressing Embodied Carbon as part of the 2023 changes (please refer to the 2023 List of Changes) and a clear direction has been given by the Foundation that the issue should be researched for further development in the Standards. The focus here is first the development of new buildings but increasing the scope of embodied carbon assessment in the future will be part of the upcoming research in this area. How will GRESB factor the purchase of RECs in scoring? GRESB is changing the requirements for reporting renewable energy and aligning the GRESB guidance relating to Renewable Energy with the Scope 2 Quality Criteria of the GHG Protocol to only reward participants for actively procuring renewable energy and no longer for solely being connected to a grid that receives a portion of its energy from renewable sources. One way to actively procure renewable energy is by purchasing RECs. To be eligible for reporting the renewable energy in the GRESB Assessment, the participant must have purchased all of their RECs for the consumption of the reporting year and legitimately retired them prior to reporting the data in the GRESB Assessment. What are the implications of the new reporting boundary requirements? GRESB is changing its reporting boundary requirements in 2023. In previous years, entities could exclude assets with an ownership stake of below 25% from their reporting scope. As of 2023, participants have to report all assets that they have any ownership stake in. This change will have an impact on the aggregation of all indicators reported at the asset level (RA2-RA5, EN1, GH1, WT1, WS1, BC). The percentage of ownership will be used as a weight in the aggregation of the asset-level data up to the property sub-type level. Furthermore, the percentage of ownership will be used in the aggregation of the property type used for the creation of the Peer Group. Will the 2023 GRESB Standards adopt the CRREM-Decarbonization Pathways in any assessment questions and is there a collaboration between GRESB and CRREM? The list of 2023 Assessment changes is final and there will be no further changes to the 2023 GRESB Assessment. Addressing net zero performance will be a topic of further discussion with the GRESB Foundation for future developments of the GRESB Standard. As part of this work, GRESB is in close contact with CRREM. Will there be any further data reporting requirements at the asset level besides the ones already specified? Specifically around the new Waste data guidance. GRESB will not introduce any additional data fields in the Asset Spreadsheet and the changes in 2023 will be limited to the ones already disclosed in the 2023 List of Changes. Therefore, there is no additional granularity required in reporting waste data. Will GRESB take into account that new assets cannot implement efficiency measures? The efficiency measure indicators are used to provide additional context to the provided consumption data. If a new asset is built including specific efficiency measures, these can still be reported. For DEN 2.1: As on-site low carbon technology will be considered with the changes in 2023, does that mean that, for example, if I have a 100% on-site low carbon tech (air source heat pumps) installed that it would possibly score a full point? Is there any space to fill in a breakdown of various types of low-carbon technology? Please refer to the Scoring Document. Each reported renewable energy source or low carbon technology has a weight of 1. The portfolio coverage is subsequently used as a multiplier. Hence, if a participant installed renewable energy sources or low carbon technologies in all their assets, i.e. 100% portfolio coverage, the participant would receive a full score for the indicator. It is possible to report ‘Other’ answers. In the field for ‘Other’ answers, it is possible to report multiple answers. For TC6.2, “Does the entity monitor its impact on the community?” – Livability Score and Walkability Score are cited as options. Does GRESB have any examples of what would be an appropriate example of such scores, if this indicator required an evidence upload? Livability and Walkability Scores are predefined metrics that are calculated in a standardized way. Please refer to the common definitions for these metrics to calculate them. In case these metrics are measured, participants are able to report accordingly in the Assessment. There is no evidence requirement for this indicator.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-acquires-asset-resolution/,"GRESB acquires Asset Resolution, deepening ESG data and insights for global investors, managers and financial institutions","AMSTERDAM, December 5, 2022 – GRESB BV, the global ESG benchmark for infrastructure and real estate investments, today announced the acquisition of Asset Resolution, an asset-based climate data and analytics provider for financial institutions. The acquisition will expand and enrich GRESB’s asset-level data coverage across hard-to-abate sectors, strengthening its assessments and tools while providing GRESB members with more actionable insights and support with asset-driven analysis. Asset Resolution’s customers, which comprise many of the world’s largest banks and consultancies, will benefit from the operational, technical and client support provided by GRESB. The business support provided by GRESB will also help enable the Asset Resolution team to further engage with external research groups and accelerate product development in support of its mission. The team will also benefit from GRESB’s technical expertise in real estate, infrastructure, ESG assessments and disclosures, sales and marketing. “This partnership is about strengthening the value and product offerings both organizations provide,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “We provide complementary services and share a common mission to equip financial institutions with the tools and insights needed to drive progress towards a more sustainable world. Combining our skill sets and teams means better data and more useful insights for our members and customers.” “This partnership represents an important step toward implementing our vision of a financial system that sets the global economy on a net-zero emissions path,” said Noémie Klein, CEO of Asset Resolution. “Together with GRESB, we’ll go further in harnessing the power of our asset-based approach to develop new data and analytics that support climate action by financial institutions.” Asset Resolution was originally created by, and spun out of, the 2° Investing Initiative France to help financial institutions access the right science-based asset-level data and finally drive progress towards a net-zero future. “When looking at acquisition partners to support the continued growth of the Asset Resolution team, we were focused on how we could enable the most impact,” said Robin Edme, President of the 2° Investing Initiative France board. “GRESB’s mission and focus on sustainability was a natural fit, and we look forward to seeing how both teams will complement each other’s work in the years to come.” As part of the acquisition, the Asset Resolution team will continue working from offices in Paris and Berlin to offer customers its existing suite of company- and asset-level indicators and analytics under the new name “Asset Impact.” The new name was selected because it reinforces the company’s vision of empowering financial institutions to translate asset-level insights into tangible outcomes. While building-level data from GRESB members will not be shared with, or included in, Asset Impact’s suite of products, the combined teams will collaborate on ways to leverage each other’s complementary expertise to provide the real assets industry and financial institutions with more comprehensive tools and resources to help organizations create a more sustainable world. In the first quarter of 2023, the teams will announce more details on staffing and resource investments and product roadmaps. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2023-gresb-standards-process-outcomes-and-changes/,"2023 GRESB Standards – Process, Outcomes, and Changes","The GRESB Foundation Board is pleased to share that all changes for the 2023 GRESB Standards have been approved. This decision was taken at a recent GRESB Foundation Board meeting held on September 14, 2022, where the Board reviewed the proposed changes for the 2023 Standards, as recommended by the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees. More detail on the process, the objectives, and the changes is available below. This is an important outcome of the new GRESB Standards Development Process, which puts the voice and priorities of GRESB Members and Partners at the forefront of this work. The 2023 changes represent the first set of Standards developed by the GRESB Foundation. GRESB New Standards Development Process – Evolving the GRESB Standards Going Forward Evolving the 2023 Standards required the GRESB Foundation Board and Standards Committees to adopt a new formalized process, designed to ensure the independence of the Foundation and the transparency of all decisions. The new process allows the GRESB Foundation, representing GRESB Members and Partners, to fulfil its mission and ensure that the standards remain by the industry, for the industry, and investor led. You can learn more about the new Standards Development Process that is now driving the evolution of the GRESB Standards in this document. This details the working relationship between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB B.V., the different stages and processes that enable the development and implementation of specific changes, as well as the more strategic evolution of the Standards. Changes to the 2023 GRESB Standards – Process and Outcomes 2022 has been a transition year to establish the new GRESB Standards Development Process and for the GRESB Foundation to take on responsibility for setting the GRESB Standards. The key objectives for the 2023 Standards changes were to: Focus on the most pressing issues, as expressed by global stakeholders through live engagement sessions and surveysMaximize the number of changes that could be reasonably achieved in the 2023 Standards Minimize the possible disruptions to participants, providing sufficient advance notice, and allowing participants to adequately prepare and adjust to the changesFollow the new process to prioritize, design, formalize, and validate the changes for 2023 For a detailed description of the implementation of the new Standards Development Process this year and the work done to prioritize key topics, as well as a high-level outline of the design of the changes across all Standards, please refer to this document. 2023 GRESB Standards – List of Changes The changes for 2023 broadly cover Net Zero; Physical Climate Risk and Transition Risk; and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This reinforces that the GRESB Foundation views climate as one of the most pressing issues for enhancement in the Standards in the current period, but also reflects that social elements of the ESG landscape are becoming more important. Please refer to the documents below for a detailed description of the changes across the GRESB Real Estate, Infrastructure Fund, and Infrastructure Asset Standards, including information on the background and purpose of the changes, a detailed description of each change, and the impact on scoring and requirements. GRESB Real Estate Standards – List of ChangesGRESB Infrastructure Fund Standards – List of ChangesGRESB Infrastructure Asset Standards – List of Changes & Materiality & Scoring Tool Looking Ahead The GRESB Foundation Board and Standards Committees will continue their work on evolving and updating the Standards and will provide a Roadmap that outlines the direction and milestones for the further development of the Standards in Q1 2023.

Significant growth was focused in the Americas (30%) and Europe (16%).Average GRESB scores increased by a point to 74 for the Standing Investments Benchmark and by two points to 81 in the Development Benchmark.Oceania continues to lead the way, with the highest regional average score of 82 in the Standing Benchmark and 88 in the Development Benchmark.Slight reductions in performance improvement scores were noted in energy, GHG emissions, water and waste reductions, as a result of real estate portfolios returning to a pre-COVID-19 state of operations. “Globally, the real estate benchmark grew by 20% in 2022, representing 1,820 listed and non-listed portfolios across 74 countries and accounting for approximately USD 6.9 trillion of GAV,” said Roussote. “We are proud to see the real estate industry deepen its commitment to ESG transparency and sustainability and lead the way in creating a more sustainable future for all.” Key infrastructure insights This year saw another increase in asset participation, with the Infrastructure Asset Assessment growing by 17% to include 652 assets and the GRESB Infrastructure Fund Assessment recording an 11% growth to cover 166 funds across 70 countries.Funds completing both assessment components now cover 70% of the benchmark with 117 entities in 2022, that is funds obtaining a GRESB Fund Score reflecting overall ESG performance at the portfolio level, with 62% portfolio coverage on average in terms of equity weight.In terms of scoring, EMEA remains the best performing region in 2022 for both infrastructure assets and funds.

GRESB data is now used by 170 institutional and financial investors with more than USD 51 trillion in assets under management. “Participation in the infrastructure benchmark continues to grow, with 2022 seeing the GAV reporting to GRESB more than double to USD 1.7 trillion since 2019,” said Roussotte. “We are proud to see the infrastructure industry double down on its commitment to ESG transparency and sustainability and achieving new important milestones with every passing year.” Full results will be made public here on October 18: gresb.com/nl-en/gresb-public-results/ GRESB Global Results Events will cover benchmark data in detail on October 18 for real estate and October 19 for infrastructure: https://events.gresb.com/ ​​​​​About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data to financial markets.

Departing GRESB Foundation Board Members Deborah Ng (formerly of Ontario Teachers Pension Plan) and Alison Schneider (formerly of Alberta Investment Management Corporation) resigned from the GRESB Foundation Board due to changes to their employment meaning that they were no longer employed by GRESB members. On behalf of the GRESB Foundation Board and GRESB BV, we wish to thank them for their immense contribution to GRESB as an organization and to the cause of sustainable real assets over many years. Looking back to 2015, Deb and Alison were integral in bringing the infrastructure asset class to GRESB, including founding the inaugural Infrastructure Advisory Board and then launching the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment in 2016. Thanks in no small part to their efforts, participation in GRESB infrastructure has grown every year and by 2022 covered over 160 funds and 660 assets. More recently, their wise counsel helped GRESB establish the GRESB Foundation and governance structure. GRESB is now in a stronger position than ever to continue its mission and realize our shared vision of “Sustainable Real Assets.” Their professionalism, constructive input, key insights, and expert advice have been an example and inspiration to many. Simply put, GRESB would not be where it is today without their incredible support. We wish them every success in their future endeavors. New appointments to the GRESB Foundation Board Shama Naqushbandi, Portfolio Manager, Value Creation & Asset Management, Infrastructure & Renewable Resources at AIMCo and Stéphane Villemain, Head of Sustainable Investment at Ivanhoé Cambridge have been appointed to the Foundation Board, at the last board meeting mid-September. As reported previously, the departure of two board members earlier this year had left two open board vacancies. We offer Ms. Naqushbandi and Mr. Villemain our warm congratulations. Foundation Board member profiles Starting this month, we will begin sharing a series of Foundation Board member profiles to give GRESB members and partners insights into the priorities and work of the Foundation and to get to know each board member.

The GRESB Foundation is currently working on communicating to our wider audience to inform them about these changes and provide insights into the new Standards development process implemented this year. Stay tuned for a more extensive update in October. Sharing the 2023 updates this early is part of the new standards operating model and will give members and prospective members more time to prepare for the upcoming reporting cycle. Join us for one of our global results events to learn more about the process and the expected changes. Earlier this year, we started a series of case studies that explore the many ways our community uses GRESB, initially looking at how our investor members engage with our data. We have now expanded the case studies to delve into how managers across real estate and infrastructure integrate GRESB into their investment processes and decision-making – from engaging with investors and benchmarking their performance against peers to identifying risks and opportunities. We hope that the resulting insights can help current and prospective members gain a greater understanding of the broad value found in ESG data and the role that the GRESB assessments can play in supporting organizational goals. Read manager case studies. Read investor case studies. Through GRESB Insights, we seek to highlight case studies on ESG integration in real assets, data-driven analyses of how the industry is responding to sustainability challenges, and educational articles exploring topics covered in the GRESB Assessments.

GPIF first joined GRESB as an Investor Member for real estate in August 2020 and has now expanded its membership to enhance environmental, social and governance (ESG) management practices across real assets. “GRESB is excited to expand our partnership with GPIF and, together, encourage further ESG data disclosure and promote constructive dialogue with investment managers across the region and the globe,” said Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “GRESB is a for-industry, by-industry organization, and we are excited to work even more closely with GPIF to help the investment industry play a larger role in creating a more sustainable world.” GPIF is the largest public fund investor in Japan and a major proponent of responsible investment and stewardship principles. Their commitment exemplifies why Japan has the highest GRESB participation rate among Asian countries.

This analysis is based on the most current CRREM pathways (September 2022), which are expected to be updated in early 2023. More information about this analysis is included in the benchmark report. Final 2022 assessment results, rankings, and benchmarks will be released on October 3, 2022.

Through this collaboration with GRESB, we can offer deeper analysis of the risks and impacts of ESG in infrastructure projects and help stimulate the market forces required to place ESG issues at the forefront of decision-making for institutional infrastructure investors.” About GRESB Established in 2009, GRESB is the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world, used by 170 institutional and financial investors to inform decision-making.

As you may recall, results of our 2021 GRESB Stakeholder Survey indicated variability in respondents’ understanding of how our data was used, particularly by institutional investors. GRESB case studies In an effort to shed light on this question, we have started a series of case studies that explore the many ways our community uses GRESB, starting with a small selection of our more than 170 investor members. The first several case studies linked below delve into how investors use GRESB in their investment processes and decision-making – from evaluating companies and engaging with fund managers to preparing for risks and emerging regulations. We hope that the resulting insights can help current and prospective members gain a greater understanding of the broad value found in ESG data and the role that the GRESB assessments can play in supporting organizational goals.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresbs-new-sfdr-reporting-solution-allows-real-estate-managers-to-solve-the-hardest-part-of-reporting-with-real-data/,GRESB’s new SFDR Reporting Solution allows real estate managers to solve the hardest part of reporting with real data,"Reporting insights will be generated through a new SFDR Assessment for real estate funds. An SFDR Assessment for infrastructure funds will be available later in the year. Amsterdam, July 25, 2022: GRESB has launched an SFDR Reporting Solution for real estate, designed to help managers with Article 8 or Article 9 funds meet the most arduous part of the new regulation – reporting on product- and entity-level ESG practices. SFDR Reporting Solution The SFDR Reporting Solution provides an interactive report that includes all the information needed for a fund manager to finalize a Principal Adverse Impact Statement, a core requirement under SFDR. The report – which will be made available following the completion of the new SFDR Assessment for real estate – highlights a fund’s: Overall product characteristics and environmental impacts, as defined by SFDR Energy consumption, estimated GHG emissions, water usage and waste generation Aggregated performance on each of the relevant Principal Adverse Impact Indicators In cases where a fund manager doesn’t have a full picture of a building’s energy consumption – which is common with triple net leases – participants can choose to use the GRESB Estimation Model (GEM), which provides a highly accurate stand-in for the missing data by comparing the floor area, location and property subtype of the building against the entire GRESB database. “Now, fund managers can tackle SFDR’s central data challenge and future-proof their year-over-year reporting from the start with better data,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “We created this solution to provide fund managers with the flexibility and the data they need to stay compliant at a very competitive price and time investment. And a significant portion of the SFDR reporting burden has been eliminated for entities that have already reported asset-level data through the 2022 GRESB Real Estate Assessment.” Product availability The SFDR Assessment for real estate is accessible now in the GRESB Portal.

While many GRESB Members and Partners are finalizing their submissions, we are looking forward to July, when we expect to announce the launch of the GRESB SFDR Assessment for real estate. SFDR is a new transparency requirement for financial market participants doing business in the European Union. For asset managers, the main challenge will be to report on detailed product-level ESG characteristics (specifically Principal Adverse Impacts, or PAIs). The GRESB SFDR Reporting Solution will help you comply with the regulation by helping you collect more accurate PAI statements from the start, future-proofing your reporting. GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model What happens if data is missing for environmental PAIs, like GHG emissions of a building? In these cases, GRESB leverages its global database of more than 100,000 individual assets to provide an estimation based on a highly representative median intensity that avoids the worst effects of outliers. Learn more about GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model and how it makes SFDR reporting more accurate. (Want to be informed when the SFDR assessment is launched? Sign up here.)

Feedback will help inform the development of the Standards Roadmap. Industry Engagement To date, GRESB engagement with the industry has primarily been via the Foundation Board and Standards Committees, with Working Groups soon to be established.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-launches-new-net-zero-and-tcfd-products-for-asset-managers/,GRESB launches new transition risk and TCFD products for asset managers,"Climate-related reporting products leverage existing GRESB Assessment data to provide powerful insights for real estate and infrastructure asset managers without additional reporting burdens Amsterdam, May 16, 2022: GRESB – the global ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments – has launched two new products to help asset managers get ahead of emerging sustainability-related business challenges, with one focused on net zero alignment and the other TCFD requirements. Transition Risk Report The first new product is the GRESB Transition Risk Report, which shows real estate portfolio managers which of their assets are most exposed to climate-related transition risk and how this may affect their portfolio over time, at both a country and global level. The report draws on asset data already provided through the annual GRESB Real Estate Assessment, benchmarking the data against CRREM’s science-based decarbonization pathways. Where needed, the report also makes use of GRESB’s Asset Estimation Model to provide portfolio managers with highly accurate estimations of GHG emissions. The resulting insights allow asset managers to: Analyze their portfolio’s overall transition risk exposure See where transition risk is concentrated within a given portfolio Prioritize decarbonization efforts at the asset level “Today, 25 percent of global real estate is already facing transition risk,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “As this number rises each year and portfolios are placed under increasing pressure to decarbonize, it’s vital that asset managers have the tools and insights necessary to navigate these risks and to take appropriate action. Because these reports are generated from data already provided through the assessment, there is no need for additional data collection efforts.” In the real estate sector, the most prominent transition risks relate to policy and regulatory changes stemming from government efforts to meet regional goals established by the Paris Agreement. Assets with excessive transition risk have high GHG emissions compared to local net zero pathways, which may result in the assets being unable to meet future regulatory requirements. To learn more about the Transition Risk Report or to schedule a demo, please visit: gresb.com/transition TCFD Alignment Report The other new product is the GRESB TCFD Alignment Report, which helps participants of any of the three GRESB Assessments – Real Estate, Infrastructure Fund and Infrastructure Asset – to tackle reporting challenges related to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD’s final recommendations that were introduced in 2017 as voluntary measures are quickly becoming integrated into regulatory frameworks across the globe. And according to the most recent GRESB data, less than 20 percent of all organizations that participate in GRESB assessments have all of the necessary processes, strategies and data collections systems in place to satisfy TCFD. Pulling together relevant information already provided to GRESB through the yearly assessments, the TCFD Alignment Report shows an entity how aligned it is to TCFD requirements and provides a clear foundation to develop necessary TCFD processes and reporting efforts. With the report, GRESB Members can: Identify TCFD gaps and where improvements can be made Compare themselves against peers and see what recommendations are being prioritized Learn how they can get fully aligned with TCFD expectations Engage with investors, highlighting climate-related risk management processes “The majority of organizations are not yet ready for TCFD and still need to translate strategies into risk management processes,” added Roussotte. “Just by participating in GRESB Assessments, organizations have already taken the first steps towards TCFD disclosures.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-foundation-update-april-2022/,GRESB Foundation update – April 2022,"The GRESB Foundation was established late last year and has been in operation throughout 2022, working on several key priorities. Following the appointment of the inaugural Foundation Board and the establishment of the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees, recruitment for the Expert Resource Groups has now been completed. Thanks to everyone who applied for this round of recruitment. The Foundation received an incredible selection of high-quality applications for both groups. Since the beginning of the year, the Foundation Board has met five times and each of the Real Estate and Infrastructure Standards Committees has met three times. This is a significant commitment from all groups, and we thank the representatives who have provided their valuable time and input in getting us to where we are today. The Foundation continues to work on the Standards Roadmap, building on the vision that was developed at the end of the year and informing the overall strategy, which is being guided by an independent strategy facilitator. Key issues identified for the GRESB Standards include: How to better address progress against core issues like Net Zero targets; Physical Climate Risk; Diversity, Equity & Inclusion; Embodied Carbon; Health & well-being; Human Rights; Biodiversity; and CybersecurityMoving from focusing more on the scoring effort to scoring outcomesBetter reflecting the different materiality of ESG issues across sectors and regions The Foundation Board has endorsed the inclusion of the CRREM Pathways into the 2022 Real Estate Benchmark Reports (for reporting only, not scored). On stakeholder engagement, the Foundation trialed a new engagement platform intended to streamline and enhance our process, and we have recruited a new Stakeholder Engagement Manager to support the Foundation, who will start on 1 May. In addition to coordinating key roles and responsibilities between the GRESB Foundation and GRESB BV, this role will facilitate the: Timely and effective engagement on the GRESB Standards with GRESB BVProvision of market research and gap analysis with other reporting frameworks, provided for by GRESB BVThe flow of information and feedback between the Foundation, GRESB BV, and industry stakeholdersProvision of appropriate support to the Foundation to ensure that it can effectively carry out its activities The Foundation Board and both Standards Committees will continue to meet on a regular basis to work on key priorities for the year, including: Publish an update on the GRESB roadmap in JuneEstablish Working Groups to tackle key topics that will feed into the roadmap process (we will reach out to the Expert Resource Groups in the coming weeks)Undertake detailed research to inform the roadmap process over the next few months, which means the Standards Committees will not meet until this has been concludedDraft the GRESB Standards RoadmapDraft the 2023 GRESB StandardsConsult with stakeholders on the draftsFinalize the GRESB Standards Roadmap by year-endFinalize the 2023 GRESB Standards by year-endConduct annual reviewsHold an annual meeting between the Foundation and the GRESB BV Supervisory Board The GRESB Roadmap Strategy was intended to be published in April; however, while working on the roadmap with the GRESB Foundation it has become clear that more detailed research is needed. We will publish an update on this work in June and then the draft standards and roadmap later in the year. The GRESB Foundation is the primary platform for GRESB to engage with the industry. To date, the focus of this engagement has been via the Foundation Board and Standards Committees, with Working Groups soon to be established. We recognize that there is a need for broader engagement with the industry and stakeholders beyond these formal groups, and we are exploring the best mechanisms for this, including: An online stakeholder engagement platform (mentioned above)Regular regional or sectoral forums for Members and PartnersUpdates included in the GRESB Newsletters We welcome input on any ideas for this broader engagement via our contact form."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/investors-unite-to-push-for-deeper-esg-reporting-across-asia-pacific/,Investors unite to push for deeper ESG reporting across Asia-Pacific,"Collaborative engagement will reach 50 companies in 12 regional markets SYDNEY, April 6, 2022 – A group of 16 investors representing US $19 trillion have launched a round of coordinated engagements to strengthen dialogue on ESG performance and GRESB participation with real estate companies across 12 key markets in the APAC region. The work is undertaken in close collaboration with GRESB, a global ESG benchmark for real estate portfolios. This year’s initiative – focused on markets such as Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan – is supported by established investors including B&I Capital, Bouwinvest, CenterSquare, Heitman, JP Morgan Asset Management, and Schroders. Real estate companies in Asia-Pacific tend to score highly in the GRESB Benchmark, often leading the world in aggregate, but tend to submit data later in their ESG journey than companies in other regions, which has led to underrepresentation in total numbers. In addition to providing ESG data directly to investors, real estate companies that participate in GRESB often indirectly benefit through ESG indices such as the iEdge-UOB APAC Green Reit Index launched in October 2021, which uses GRESB Assessment performance data. This year, 50 companies will be engaged and invited to participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. This is an expansion from last year, in which 13 investors collaborated with GRESB to reach out to more than 30 companies in nine Asian markets. Tomas Hlavaty, Sustainability & Data Analyst – B&I Capital “We are convinced any company developing and reporting its ESG positively contributes to the evolution of market best practice, transparency, data collection, and impact which is beneficial to all stakeholders and common goals.” Tim Kesseler, Portfolio Analyst, Listed – Bouwinvest “We develop full ESG models in addition to our financial models for our integrated listed and non-listed investments. At Bouwinvest we view companies with strong ESG standards favorably. It is very helpful where companies participate in GRESB as this means that the information will go automatically into our models.” Joachim Kehr, Portfolio & Regional Manager, Asia-Pacific – CenterSquare “At CenterSquare our investment experience over the past decades has taught us that ESG integration is a key driver of performance and participation in GRESB allows us and company participants to measure said integration in a transparent and comparable way. Increased engagement particularly through GRESB is a cornerstone of continually improving performance and impacting positive change.” John White, Senior Managing Director, Asia-Pacific – Heitman “We see multiple risks and opportunities from ESG. Where companies are effectively managing their stakeholders this is a signal of better quality management.” JP Morgan Asset Management “Real estate companies that do not keep pace with strong ESG credentials are likely to face accelerated obsolescence in a world where investors increasingly avoid properties that are left behind from an environmental perspective. We look forward to exercising our stewardship responsibilities in partnership with GRESB to support APAC real estate companies’ outperformance both financially and environmentally.” Justin Blaess, Principal & Portfolio Manager – Quay Global Investors “Companies that take a proactive approach to ESG issues and disclosure are more likely to be tomorrow’s winners.” Tom Walker, Co-Head of Global Listed Real Assets – Schroders “While investors always like to see listed developers and REITs with high GRESB scores, we want to see broad industry participation; it is important that the real estate sector unifies behind an agreed set of principles. GRESB participation allows us to see how a fund is changing and improving over time. To us, it is key that companies start the process and understand the crucial role they can play.” Investors supporting the engagement include: Aegon Asset Management AEW B&I Capital BMO Global Asset Management Bouwinvest CenterSquare Cohen & Steers Heitman JP Morgan Asset Management Legal & General Investment Management MFS Investment Management Quay Global Investors Resolution Capital Schroders About GRESB GRESB is a mission-driven and industry-led organization providing standardized and validated Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) data to financial markets. Established in 2009, GRESB has become the leading ESG benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world, used by 150 institutional and financial investors to inform decision-making. GRESB standards are governed by the independent, not-for-profit GRESB Foundation, while ESG assessments are managed by GRESB BV, a benefit corporation. For more information, visit GRESB.com"

AMSTERDAM, November 22, 2021 – GRESB is pleased to announce that it has established the independent, non-profit GRESB Foundation (a Dutch stichting) to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based. This follows the management buy-out of GRESB from GBCI in November 2020 in partnership with global alternative investment firm, Summit Partners. Our shared industry vision is a real asset investment industry that plays a critical role in creating a sustainable world – one where society can meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. The transition to sustainable real assets is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, standardized global benchmarks and collective action from all our stakeholders as we work towards a more sustainable future. GRESB’s new governance structure is shown in the diagram below: The GRESB Foundation has established a new governance structure, consisting of Standards Committees, Expert Resource Groups and Working Groups. The GRESB Foundation Board will start a formal nomination and selection process from GRESB members to fill vacant roles on its Board and positions on the committees and resource groups. Reflecting the “investor-led” nature of GRESB, at least two-thirds of these positions will be held by representatives of investor members and up to one-third by participant members, industry partners (i.e. industry associations) and partners. “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by-industry, for-industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization. I look forward to serving on the Foundation Board alongside my former GRESB non-executive director colleagues – Deborah Ng, Head of Responsible Investing and Director, Total Fund Management, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), and Mathieu Elshout, Head of Sustainability & Impact Investing, PATRIZIA, as well as the chairs of the current GRESB Advisory Boards – Alison Schneider, Vice President, Responsible Investment, Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), and Kathleen Jowett, Fund Manager, LaSalle Global Partner Solutions.” GRESB BV will continue to be responsible for administering the GRESB Assessments, providing the assessment, validation, scoring and benchmarking as well as promoting widespread adoption of the GRESB Standards and supporting its members. GRESB BV is a benefit corporation, which will seek formal B-Corp certification in order to protect the accountability for its mission over the long term. “Since the change of ownership last year, we have collaborated with trusted and recognized industry leaders on the details of the GRESB Foundation and how it will work with GRESB BV to continue the important work of GRESB over the last 11 years and set a solid foundation for the future,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB BV. “With the need for reliable ESG data only becoming more important, this new structure formalizes our engagement with investors, managers and other stakeholders, ensuring that all of our activities are in tune with the needs of our industry.“ Christian Strain, Chairman of GRESB BV Supervisory Board, said, “Representing the new shareholders in GRESB, we are very pleased that the non-profit part of the organisation has now been formally established.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/greener-yields-from-reits/,Greener Yields from REITs,"Key Highlights REITs are favoured by investors as they offer attributes from both fixed income and equities, while providing exposure to real assets. In line with the rise of interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors the concept of “double materiality” is making its way into the world of REITs, where the effects of environmental and social issues on the REIT’s activities and bottom line, as well as the effect of the REIT’s activities on the environment and society are considered. In a 2021 JLL survey of over 550 occupiers and real estate investors in the Asia Pacific, over 70% of corporate occupiers are willing to pay a rental premium to lease certified green buildings as part of efforts to meet their decarbonisation goals. Between 2020 to 2030, Cushman and Wakefield projects demand for an additional 1.35 billion square feet of office space across the Asia Pacific region. The iEdge-UOB APAC Yield Focus Green REIT index uses GRESB Assessment data to deliver improved risk-adjusted performance by rewarding REITs with a higher weight based on the environmental performance of the REITs. GRESB is a mission driven and investor led organization providing standardized and validated ESG data to the capital markets through an annual self-reported assessment that is scored by GRESB. The material environmental performance aspects of the REITs are measured using four indicators; Energy Consumption, Water Consumption, Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Green Building Certifications The index provides comparable financial performance to a broader APAC REITs index while providing improved environmental performance. The index methodology will be periodically updated to incorporate advancements in the GRESB assessment methodologies as well as improvements to data quality and granularity, with the objective of selecting the highest quality REITs with improved environmental performance.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/australia-continues-to-lead-the-way-in-gresb-results/,Australia continues to lead the way in GRESB results,"Tuesday, 19 October 2021 Key insights Australia has ranked number one in GRESB results for the 11th consecutive year Oceania maintains the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark The 2021 benchmark saw GRESB’s largest ever growth; the group of listed entities grew by 20%, the non-listed group grew by 25% GRESB now covers US$5.7 trillion of assets under management, up from US$4.8 trillion in 2020, and nearly 117,000 individual assets Notable performance improvements were recorded in GHG emission, water and waste reductions with the most improvement seen in materials, highlighting the increased focus on material selection and embodied carbon Australian property companies have topped the results of the 2021 GRESB Real Estate Assessment ranking, proving once again that Australia’s real estate sector leads the world in sustainability. GRESB is the global benchmark for environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of real assets and Green Building Council of Australia’s (GBCA) CEO Davina Rooney has applauded Australian companies for outperforming other regions for the eleventh consecutive year. “In what has been a challenging year globally, our region keeps lifting the bar of ESG and sustainability within the property sector by meeting GRESB’s targets then innovating to improve results year on year. “As we all have our eyes set on Glasgow as COP26 approaches, Australia’s property sector has strengthened its commitment to climate change mitigation, emission reduction and sustainability performance, and this commitment is second to none,” Ms Rooney said. The GRESB Real Estate Assessment generates two benchmarks. The GRESB Standing Investments Benchmark considers management and performance factors and is is aimed at portfolios with operating buildings, while the GRESB Development Benchmark considers management and development factors and is for portfolios with new construction and major renovation projects. Globally, Oceania maintains the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Investment Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark. Participation in the GRESB Assessment experienced its largest ever growth with the group of listed entities growing by 20% while the non-listed group grew by 25%, a spike likely driven by investor interest in ESG data and industry’s focus on emerging regulations. Property Council of Australia’s Chief Executive, Ken Morrison, says GRESB’s ESG data is highly valued by investors, and defines the standards of sustainability performance and reporting. “GRESB continues to set the international goalposts for ESG performance and Australia continues to score highly, showing the rest of the world how a sustainable, net zero and healthy future is possible. “Our industry’s leadership is testament to what can be achieved when targets are in place and our sector leaders should be recognised and praised for their willingness to innovate to meet these goals,” Mr Morrison said. GRESB’s Head of Asia Pacific, Ruben Langbroek, says the impacts of climate change and the international pandemic have accelerated responsible investments within the property industry, with institutional investors increasingly allocating their capital to portfolios that generate positive environmental, social and economic outcomes. “We are realising that the environmental and social challenges we face cannot be solved with a business-as-usual approach. Our industry needs to respond by building back better, reaching net zero earlier and moreover, becoming climate positive. “The 2021 GRESB results for Oceania show that transformative change is possible, and transparency on ESG performance supports this transition,” Mr Langbroek said. — GRESB’s global leaders for Australia 2021 GRESB Real Estate Standing Investments Sector Leaders Overall Global Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector)* Office – Shared between Lendlease International Towers Sydney Trust, Lendlease; and Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Non-listed – Australian Prime Property Fund Retail, Lendlease *Overall Global Sector Leaders are also recognised as being the “Global Sector Leaders” by GRESB for achieving the highest score for the combination of nature of ownership and sector Overall Regional Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector and region) Diversified – Office/Retail – Dexus Wholesale Property Fund, Dexus Industrial – Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited, Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited Office – Shared between Lendlease International Towers Sydney Trust, Lendlease; and Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Australian Prime Property Fund Retail, Lendlease Diversified – Office/Industrial – Shared between Cromwell Property Trust 12, Cromwell Property Group; and Growthpoint Properties Australia, GrowthPoint 2021 GRESB Real Estate Development Sector Leaders Overall Global Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector)* Diversified – ISPT Core Fund, ISPT Pty Ltd Diversified – Office/Industrial – Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited, Frasers Property Industrial Australia Pty Limited Office – Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Retail – Shared between Scentre Group, Scentre Group; and Unisuper, managed by AMP Capital Investors Limited *Overall Global Sector Leaders are also recognised as being the “Global Sector Leaders” by GRESB for achieving the highest score for the combination of nature of ownership and sector Overall Regional Sector Leaders (Achieved highest score for its sector and region) Industrial – Shared between Core Logistics Partnership (CLP), Charter Hall; and Goodman Australia Partnership (GAP), Goodman Group Office – Australian Prime Property Fund Commercial, Lendlease Residential – Lendlease Retirement Living Trust, Lendlease Retail – Shared between Scentre Group, Scentre Group; and Unisuper, managed by AMP Capital Investors Limited About Green Building Council of Australia Green Building Council of Australia (GBCA) is the nation’s authority on sustainable buildings and communities.

Developed by SGX as part of the SGX iEdge product suite, in collaboration with UOBAM, the index covers 50 higher-yielding REITs that display relatively better environmental performance based on GRESB’s real estate assessment, while also meeting liquidity requirements. GRESB is the global leader for ESG research of real assets, covering over 1,500 property companies, REITS, funds and developers with US$5.7 trillion in assets under management. For this index, the underlying REITs are weighted by their relative environmental performance using GRESB data for indicators such as energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and green building certifications, in addition to their ESG performance. Ng Kin Yee, Managing Director and Head of Data, Connectivity and Indices, SGX, said, “Sustainable investing is now a key consideration in portfolio allocation, and this is driving demand and innovation in partnership with iEdge’s indexing services. Since the establishment of iEdge, we have been customising and developing proprietary indices for our global clients, in a well-governed manner through purpose-driven design, strong research and data partnerships.” “This new index in partnership with UOBAM and GRESB is uniquely underpinned by Singapore’s position as the most international REIT hub globally, and we look forward to this index becoming investible for market participants who are increasingly environmentally focused,” he added. Thio Boon Kiat, Chief Executive Officer, UOBAM, said, “The APAC Green REIT Index seeks to respond to market demand for ESG-focused investment products and aligns with UOB Asset Management’s aim of driving sustainability by putting environment, social and governance (ESG) impact at the heart of our business. While investors are keen to put their money in quality companies that are sustainable and score highly on ESG metrics, data on the companies’ ESG performance can be difficult to discern. UOBAM brings more than three decades of investment expertise in Asia to incorporate ESG factors and considerations into REITS investments and this rigorously constructed index will help investors to invest for both profit and purpose.” Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB, said, “Transitioning to a sustainable world is a fundamental challenge that we must face together. GRESB is pleased to partner with SGX and UOBAM to support the growth in sustainable real estate across the Asia-Pacific region and provide global investors with the critical data needed to align their investment allocations with ESG integration practices.”"

Key real estate insights The 2021 benchmark saw the largest ever growth in total numbers, with 1,520 entities now participating worldwide, with significant growth focused in Europe Average GRESB scores increased to 73 for the Standing Investments Benchmark and 79 in the Development Benchmark, following last year’s assessment restructure Oceania continues to lead the way, with the highest regional average score of 79 in the Standing Benchmark and 84 in the Development Benchmark Significant performance improvements were noted in GHG emission, water and waste reductions, a result of both Covid-19 and continued investment in improving efficiencies Key infrastructure insights This year saw the largest ever increase in asset participation, with 558 assets now reporting, and the second largest increase in fund participation, now at 149 Funds completing both assessment components jumped 41% to 106, that is funds obtaining a GRESB Fund Score reflecting overall ESG performance at the portfolio level While few assets have net zero targets, recent commitments by managers representing 40% of reporting assets are expected to drive significant increases in the years ahead Asset participation growth was led by Renewable Power, with a 65% increase from 2020 Significant regional growth in asset participation was seen in the Americas (35%) and Asia (48%) Overall, the gross asset value reporting to GRESB has increased by more than 50% since 2019 “Across the globe, organizations are demonstrating a deep commitment to ESG integration while making important strides towards a more sustainable future for us all,” said Sebastien Roussotte, CEO of GRESB. “ESG transparency and improving overall performance have never been more important, and it is inspiring to see such a high level of dedication across industries.” Real Estate Results Participation in the Real Estate Benchmark grew by 24% this year, to 1,520. This is the highest percentage increase the assessment has seen since 2012 and the highest ever increase in total numbers. The benchmark now covers $5.7 trillion of AuM (up from $4.8 trillion) and nearly 117,000 individual assets. Growth has been driven mainly by Europe, which saw massive growth for the second year in a row and now accounts for nearly half of the entire benchmark. High continued growth in Europe is likely driven by both investor interest in ESG data and the industry’s focus on and attention to emerging regulations. The group of listed entities grew by 20% while the non-listed group grew by 25%. The Real Estate Benchmark now covers 49 of PERE’s Top 100 Fund Managers and has 69% coverage of the main global listed real estate indices. While average GRESB scores in 2020 were affected by last year’s assessment restructure, this year saw renewed score improvements. The average Standing Investments Benchmark score is 73 and the average Development Benchmark score is 79. Oceania continues to lead the way with averages scores of 79 and 84, respectively. Participants improved on scores across nearly every aspect of the assessment. Score improvement was particularly high in Data Monitoring & Review (a 9% average increase), underlying increased global efforts to improve verification of performance data. On the development side, the most improvement was seen in Materials, highlighting more focus on material selection and embodied carbon tracking in developments and renovations. The global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is noticeably reflected in performance scores. This year’s benchmark shows unprecedented reductions in utility usage, with like-for-like reductions in energy consumption, GHG emissions and water usage nearly threefold from previous years. These reductions were most pronounced in Asia, which saw decreases in energy consumption (8%), GHG emissions (10%) and water consumption (11%). To complement the Real Estate Assessment this year, GRESB surveyed Members and Partners on how Covid-19 has affected portfolio performance. Results showed that these sizable reductions are not solely attributable to the pandemic – participants are also making significant improvements engaging tenants and implementing efficiency measures. “This year, participation in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment jumped an impressive 24% to 1,520 portfolios across the globe,” said Charles van Thiel, Director of Real Estate at GRESB. “The industry continues to make impressive strides, deepening its commitment to ESG transparency and focusing on improving sustainability performance.” Infrastructure Results Despite the continued challenges posed by Covid-19, total participation in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 26%, to 149 funds completing the Management Component. The number of infrastructure funds completing both the Management and Performance components of the Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 41% to 106. The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers $343 billion of AuM at the fund level and $738 billion of AuM at the asset level. The fund assessment covers over 30% of the IPE Real Assets Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers and over a third of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50, based on participation with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 31% to cover 558 assets. While most assets are based in Europe, significant relative growth in participation numbers came from the Americas (105 to 142) and Asia (21 to 31). The assessment now covers 33 of the 34 industry sectors and 2,096 facilities across 69 countries. The average percentage of individual assets within funds reporting to GRESB continues to grow, which is now up to 83%. This increase shows that infrastructure managers are moving closer to asset-level reporting. By sector, Renewable Power saw the highest growth in participation (65%), followed by Environmental Services (64%), Transport (44%) and Network Utilities (27%). When it comes to GRESB scores, both funds and assets saw significant increases this year, similar to the impressive increases seen in 2020. On average, overall GRESB scores and component scores increased from 5 to 15 points. At the fund level, thirteen entities scored the maximum 100 for the Management Component, while only two saw score decreases. For assets, the average GRESB score increase was 10 points, largely coming from the Performance Component. By asset type, Diversified and Network Utilities are the top performing assets, with average GRESB scores of 80 and 79, respectively. The asset types that improved the most since last year were Social Infrastructure, with a 22 point increase, and Diversified, with a 20 point increase. The 2021 Infrastructure Asset Assessment shows continued improvement in target setting across all performance indicators, suggesting future improvements in performance that will follow. Among infrastructure assets and funds, Diversity has shown little to no improvement. While the average fund has an employee gender ratio of 40:60 between women and men, only 28% of funds’ governance and management roles are filled by women. As net zero is a growing interest in the industry, GRESB analysed the target setting that fund managers have committed to for their underlying portfolios. We found that – while Scope 1 and 2 GHG targets are often set by managers for at least one asset in their fund (57%) – only 23% of funds participating in the assessment have an asset in their portfolio with a net zero target. Even fewer (9%) have set science-based targets. That said, fund managers representing just over 40% of all our reporting assets became signatories to the “Net Zero Asset Managers” commitment in December 2020. We expect that in the coming years the number of net zero targets will spike, as assessment reporting reflects these recent commitments. “The infrastructure industry continues to make significant progress in its approach to ESG, with GRESB participation growing year over year,” said Roussotte. “We are proud to see the industry deepen its commitment to ESG transparency and continue improving overall performance.” Media contact: Tyler Guthrie, Director of Communications, GRESB [email protected]"

As the risks of climate change become more pronounced, participants are making important strides in accelerating the transition to a more sustainable asset industry.” The 2021 GRESB benchmarks cover the ESG performance of real estate and infrastructure funds, companies and assets, providing investors with validated data and a window into complex sustainability issues. GRESB data is now used by 140 institutional investors – with more than $47 trillion in assets under management – to better understand and benchmark the performance of their portfolios. This transparent data helps bridge the knowledge gap between actual and predictive performance in order to manage business risks and opportunities while accelerating the growth of responsible investment. 2021 Real Estate coverage This year, 1,520 property companies, REITs, funds and developers participated in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment (up from 1,229 in 2020), generating a benchmark that covers $5.7 trillion of AuM (up from $4.8 trillion). The benchmark covers nearly 117,000 assets (up from 96,000 last year), all of which are reported at the asset level. The data combines high-level overall scores with in-depth information across hundreds of ESG data points, including performance indicators such as GHG emissions, waste and energy and water consumption. The dataset now covers 1,187 non-listed funds and 326 listed property companies and REITs (up from 958 and 271, respectively) as well as seven governmental entities. When combined with the GRESB Public Disclosure Dataset, this includes full coverage of all major listed real estate indices. While global real estate participation increased by 24% this year, there were notable regional increases: Italian market coverage grew the most, both in terms of absolute and relative increases, with more than 50 new entities participating (a 329% increase from last year) German market coverage increased by 68%, with more than 30 new entities participating The United States market has now reached 300 participating entities The Japanese and Australian markets have both reached over 100 participating entities 2021 Infrastructure coverage The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 26% to cover 149 funds (up from 118 last year), and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 31% to include 558 assets (up from 426). The Infrastructure Benchmark now covers $343 billion of AuM at the fund level and $738 billion of AuM at the asset level. Assets that now participate in the Assessment are located in 69 countries, up from 59 last year. The average percentage of individual assets within funds reporting to GRESB continues to grow, which is now up to 83% – 6% higher than last year. This increase shows that infrastructure managers are moving closer to asset-level reporting. For the Asset Assessment, the Transport and Renewable Power sectors saw significant growth of 44% and 65%, respectively. The benchmark now reflects 148 transport assets and 134 renewable power assets. Paving the way for industry transformation Transitioning to a sustainable world is a fundamental challenge that we must face together. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, standardized global benchmarks and collective action from all stakeholders. Thank you, to all our participants, investor members and partners for your continued commitment to advancing ESG integration.

Standing as a testament to the industry’s resilience, GRESB is excited to announce that the number of participants this year greatly exceeded our growth targets for FY2021. Our gratitude extends to all of the hard-working teams who progressed tirelessly to collect the data, work through the challenges and coordinate the reporting. Together, we strengthen the calibre of the GRESB Benchmark every year. We’ll soon release full details to illustrate how comprehensive and representative of the industry our ESG benchmarks are. Below are just a few key highlights: 2021 Real Estate Coverage: 1,520 (2020: 1,229) real estate property companies, REITs, and real estate developers participated in the Real Estate Assessment, a 24% increase compared to 2020. 2021 Infrastructure Fund Coverage: The Infrastructure Fund Assessment saw a growth in participation of 26% to cover 149 funds (2020: 118). 2021 Infrastructure Asset Coverage: The Infrastructure Asset Assessment saw a growth in participation of 31% to cover 558 assets (2020: 426). ​​​​2021 Overall Participation: Overall GRESB Assessment participation grew from 1773 submissions in 2020, to 2227 in 2021, a staggering 26% increase.

Kind regards, GRESB The validation process conducted by SRI Quality System Registrar, our accredited third-party assessment body, is now underway. We estimate more than 47,200 human validation decisions will be taken this year to ensure the quality of the reported data in preparation for scoring and benchmarking. This manual validation process complements the automated checks on information completeness, accuracy and reporting rules integrated in the Portal. In parallel, the Real Estate Team is conducting a reporting boundaries review to ensure portfolios submit 100% of their underlying assets. From September 1st – when the preliminary benchmark reports will be available – to September 15th, Participants can make official requests for validation and scoring reviews. Assessments and scores can then be updated until September 26. The launch of 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessment results will be October 1st. A more detailed overview of the Assessment timeline can be found here. SFDR | The ESAs have published a Q&A which provides further clarifications as to what constitutes article 8 and 9 products. Some of these clarifications remain vague, for instance, what constitutes the promotion of Environmental and Social Characteristics for Article 8 and whether sustainable investments for Article 9 products, defined in article 2 (17) of Regulation (EU) 2019/2088, have any overlap with the EU taxonomy’s own definition of what qualifies as a sustainable investment. This comes after the European Commision announced a 6 month delay in the application of the RTS leaving a big question mark as to if the final RTS documentation, originally meant to be published in June, will actually see the light of day. As such, GRESB remains attentive to any future developments. If you would like to keep up to date on our proposed solution and relevant SFDR resources you can do so via our SFDR Reporting Solution page.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-the-countdown-begins-as-the-reporting-period-comes-to-an-end/,GRESB Newsletter | The countdown begins as the reporting period comes to an end.,"With only days left until the end of the 2021 GRESB reporting period, the Portal submission rates, from both infrastructure and real estate managers alike, stand as a testament to the industry’s dedication to achieving sustainable real assets. Preliminary GRESB participation numbers demonstrate a change in attitude from easily neglected ‘non-financial’ factors to active engagement in the long term sustainability practices of businesses. These sentiments are echoed in the industry’s momentum towards net zero initiatives and climate related disclosures; from nations, coalitions of financial institutions and real estate industry bodies we are seeing a monumental shift towards sustainability commitments. While commitment is a necessary first step, much focus has now been rightly shifted toward execution. Financial actors and real asset operators alike are in need of credible tools and standards that are able to put their assets and portfolios into the context of these high-level commitments. GRESB is proactively working on answering the industry’s call by working on a solutionthat will help its Members evaluate the climate transition risk of their real estate portfolios and assets; you can find out more here. All participants: The deadline for the 2021 Assessments is July 1, 23:59 PDT It’s your last chance to log into the Portal to finish your Assessment and be part of the 2021 Benchmark. If you have questions or need assistance to meet the deadline, just contact us. We’re here to help. Listed Companies: Your ESG Public Disclosure evaluation is ready for review If you are a listed property or infrastructure company, GRESB has collected information on the transparency of your sustainability practices sourced from your website, sustainability reports, annual reports and other public records, in order to benchmark your ESG disclosure. This information is available for your review in the GRESB Portal.

Kind regards,GRESB SFDR | GRESB is introducing an SFDR reporting solution to help real estate, infrastructure, and private equity managers to meet their regulatory disclosure obligations. To support this work we recently conducted a series of interviews with GRESB members sharing and gathering feedback on our prototypes for a Principle Adverse Impact Statements solution for both Real Estate and Infrastructure (Funds and Assets) in compliance with Article 7 of SFDR. A big thanks to all members who provided their valuable feedback. The adoption of the SFDR Regulator Technical Standards (RTS) from the European Commission is expected by the end of June and we are keeping a watchful eye on any developments. On the EU Taxonomy side, the EU has released its EU Taxonomy Compass. The EU Taxonomy Compass aims to make the contents of the EU Taxonomy easier to access for a variety of users. It enables users to check which activities are included in the EU Taxonomy (taxonomy-eligible activities), to which objectives they substantially contribute and what criteria they have to meet. Also note that the first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act is currently under review by the European Parliament and the Council. If you would like to keep up to date on our proposed solution and relevant SFDR resources you can do so via our SFDR Reporting Solution page.TCFD | GRESB is developing a TCFD reporting solution to help contextualize practices of the reported entity in the context of the TCFD. The data reported in the new resilience indicators of the main Assessments will be the backbone of these entity-specific TCFD Reports. The data provided for these indicators will be restructured to align with the 11 TCFD recommended disclosures and will leverage GRESB’s core capabilities of validation, transparent scoring, and peer benchmarking. For more information about the indicators that are taken into account, please refer to the GRESB TCFD Reports Indicator Overview. You can access all existing GRESB-TCFD information, such as webinars, resources and articles, via GRESB’s TCFD page. GRESB is hiring!

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-accelerates-investment-and-announces-leadership-changes/,GRESB Accelerates Investment and Announces Leadership Changes,"Amsterdam, 28th June, 2021 13:00pm CEST: As GRESB enters a new phase of accelerated growth, we’re pleased to announce a strengthened Management Board to lead our growing team. The wave of global interest in ESG, from regulators and market participants alike, is ushering us into a new era of ESG performance assessment and benchmarking. We’re working not only to further standardize ESG data for the capital markets, but also to provide new tools to the industry to assist in meeting new regulatory requirements, enhance the management of sustainability risks, and accelerate the growth of responsible investment. All of this contributes to GRESB fulfilling our mission as a benefit corporation. We are growing the GRESB team, adding more capacity to support our stakeholders, and further investing in our data science and technology capabilities to strengthen our platform and will allow us to develop more products and tools to support both our benchmark participants and our investor members. New in 2021 GRESB is working hard on three new products which will be released in 2021 and 2022. We’re introducing an EU Regulatory (SFDR) Reporting Solution to help GRESB participants to meet their regulatory disclosure obligations. For our Members needing support with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we’re also developing a reporting solution. Finally, we are working on better understanding the real estate industry’s needs in relation to transition risk analytics built from the bottom-up, leveraging on CRREM’s decarbonization pathways. GRESB Management Board: To support this new era for GRESB, we have strengthened the capabilities of our Management Board bringing in key new hires with a diverse range of experience and skills to complement the existing staff. Our new CEO, Sebastien Roussotte brings extensive experience at the top level of financial services and data firms including Thomson Reuters, Sophis, Finastra and Style Analytics. Our new Chief Commercial Officer, Guido Wagenaar brings more than 20 years experience in sales, marketing and business development, and our new CFO, Roel de Weerd has an accounting background with experience in c-suite roles in the property sector. They join Roxana Isaiu who now heads up our ESG & Benchmarks pillar comprising our Real Estate and Infrastructure teams; and Rick Walters, who has moved into a new role as Chief of Standards and Innovation, our key liaison with the GRESB Foundation and responsible for new product development. These changes see the departure of GRESB co-founder and former CEO, Sander Paul van Tongeren, who leaves a very valuable legacy to the staff and the industry; ‘In my tenure at GRESB, it has been inspiring to witness the collective industry effort to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets. I am proud to have contributed to this movement, and I am optimistic that GRESB will continue paving the way for a more sustainable real asset industry’, said Sander Paul. Sebastien commented : ‘GRESB is uniquely placed to help asset owners and investors with the guidance they need to measure and report on their key ESG indicators. We look forward to building on the successes to date while strengthening our collaboration with existing members and partners to uncover new ESG insights that are essential to support sustainable investment decision making.’ We’re delighted to welcome Sebastien, Guido, and Roel to the team as we embark on a new era for GRESB."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-sfdr-data-in-review/,GRESB and SFDR – Data in review,"GRESB has conducted a market analysis of publicly available level 1 disclosures from GRESB Fund Managers with activities in Europe to determine whether these business practices mention product classifications. SFDR from afar Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), sets standards for classifying funds or products as “grey” Article 6, “light green” Article 8 or “dark green” Article 9, with each level of classification having different product documentation and marketing materials, with strict reporting requirements for “green” funds. You can find out more about SFDR developments here. GRESB’s analysis explores both the Real Estate and Infrastructure domain. Real Estate Real Estate Findings Based on our analysis of 100 Real Estate Fund Managers with activities in Europe, 11% mentioned having products falling under Article 8, with 4% under article 9, and 7% specifically mentioning being Article 6. This suggests a rather conservative and cautious approach into disclosing product categorization information most probably due to remaining unclarities over specific requirements for Article 8 and 9. Product level disclosures are expected to come into force as of January 2022 with pre-contractual and periodic reporting and disclosure requirements. Findings also showed that no information relating to SFDR could be found for 71% of the 100 Real Estate Fund managers, and in addition to that, 17% of the Fund Managers researched have some level 1 disclosures in place but no product categorization at this stage. Interestingly enough, 31% of the FMP’s with SFDR disclosures (29) , mention GRESB with some saying that GRESB is the data source they use to measure and/or monitor the characteristics promoted by their products. Infrastructure Infrastructure Findings Based on our analysis of 33 Infrastructure fund managers with activities in Europe, 21% mentioned having products falling under Article 8, with 12% under article 9, only 3% specifically mentioning being Article 6. Note that 33% have some level 1 disclosures in place but no product categorization at this stage. Findings also showed that no information relating to SFDR could be found for 30% of the 33 Infrastructure Fund managers. This suggests a rather conservative and cautious approach into disclosing product categorization information most probably due to remaining unclarities over specific requirements for Article 8 and 9. Product level disclosures are expected to come into force as of January 2022 with pre-contractual and periodic reporting and disclosure requirements. Interestingly enough, 30% of the 20 FMP’s that have SFDR related disclosures, mention GRESB as being the data source they use to measure and/or monitor the characteristics promoted by their products. GRESB is introducing an SFDR reporting solution to help GRESB participants to meet their regulatory disclosure obligations. At the forefront of ESG reporting, GRESB is well placed to bridge the identified gaps and provide a simple way for the industry to meet their regulatory obligations with minimum reporting burden.

GRESB is working with the Interim Foundation Council (the name for the initial Foundation Board prior to the Board being officially constituted) to finalize the documents to formally establish the GRESB Foundation. We have been meeting regularly to review the documents and expect that these can be finalized in the next few weeks. Due to the delay regarding the establishment of the Foundation, we are utilizing a modified approach to governance for 2021 utilizing a longer transition period to the Foundation. The existing governance groups (Real Estate and Infrastructure Advisory Boards and Benchmark Committees) will continue to meet as per usual until the Foundation is fully established. They will review the GRESB strategy and work on the 2022 Assessments. Once the Foundation is fully established and all Foundation Committees are in place, the existing governance groups will cease, and all work will transfer to the Foundation (including its Board and Committees). The process to establish the Foundation Committees needs to be designed by the Foundation Board. There may be differences compared to the existing governance groups in terms of structure, role and composition. The process for establishing these committees should be fair and transparent. We will advise all GRESB members once more information is available. Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Level I requirements have come into effect, and although a momentous milestone, there is still a long way to go until full implementation and disclosure. Despite its simple goal, the new SFDR requirements still leave room for diverse interpretation. As investors and fund managers embark on the journey of getting more familiar with the interpretation of the regulation as well as product disclosure depending on their categorization, peer discussions and engagement with their underlying investments are needed to make implementation and full disclosure at both entity and product level successful. GRESB is proactively monitoring the discussions and if you would like to keep up to date on our proposed solution and relevant SFDR resources you can do so here Pressure to disclose climate-related information is ramping up globally. New Zealand introduced a bill that will make climate-related disclosures mandatory for many listed issuers, large registered banks, investors, and asset managers. This was followed quickly by the re-introduction of a bill in the United States, which would require public companies to disclose specific climate-related information. GRESB seeks to help fund managers and investors understand their processes in relation to the TCFD’s recommendations, widely recognized as international best practice. Transition Risk Tool The latest CRREM publication, CRREM Report No. 5 on lessons learned and best-practice users, highlights the utility and versatility of the CRREM decarbonization pathways and sets precedence for best practice transition risk and climate goal alignment communication within the real estate sector. Highlighting the importance of industry standardization, GRESB seeks to make information on the Paris alignment, performance, and transition risks of Member assets even more accessible to them.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-crrem-and-pcaf-join-forces/,"GRESB, CRREM and PCAF Join Forces","GRESB, PCAF [Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials], and CRREM [Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor] are partnering up in 2021 to provide investors and banks with the guidance they need to measure and report on their financed emissions from real estate. Furthermore, this partnership is meant to help financial institutions formulate, set, and implement forward-looking targets in relation to their financed emissions. Amsterdam – April 21, 2021 – As the race to net zero gains momentum and regulatory bodies across the world scrutinize how the financial industry can influence the global push toward a more sustainable future, the ability to measure and understand financed emissions has never been more important. The trifecta of GRESB, PCAF, and CRREM is perfectly positioned to give guidance to investors and banks to do just that for their real estate portfolios. Over the course of 2021, the three bodies are partnering to harmonize their efforts and provide additional guidance to PCAF’s Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry, released in its first edition in November 2020. The additional guidance will focus on the specific requirements and needs of the real estate sector. Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets at APG Asset Management and member of the GRESB Interim Foundation Council: “As the stewards of ESG data and standards for real assets, the GRESB Foundation welcomes the opportunity to work with PCAF and CRREM to provide the financial industry with the standardization and tools it needs to effectively calculate and communicate on its financed emissions within the real estate sector.” Giel Linthorst, Executive Director of PCAF: “This partnership with GRESB and CRREM is a clear example of the harmonization efforts that the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) has been working on. Alignment and harmonization with other initiatives is crucial to enable the financial sector to effectively measure, report, set targets and take actions towards net zero.” Prof. Dr. Sven Bienert, Founder and Managing Director of IIÖ: “Whereas in the past investors/owners were seen as the driving force to track, analyse and reduce energy consumption within the real estate industry, we recognize now another force supporting decarbonization efforts. Banks and other financial institutions providing debt to the market are increasingly demanding clarity regarding financed emissions – impact on loan pricing and lending can be expected soon.” The collaboration seeks to release its output this fall. The need for such guidance highlights the increasing importance of having a common framework across both investors and banks to measure and steer towards net-zero goals. About GRESB Mission-driven and investor-led, GRESB is the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets. It works in collaboration with the industry to provide standardized and validated ESG data to the capital markets. The GRESB 2020 Real Estate benchmark covered more than 1,200 property companies, real estate investment trusts (REITs), funds, and developers. Its coverage for infrastructure includes 540 infrastructure funds and assets. Combined, GRESB represents over USD 4.5 trillion in real asset value. More than 100 institutional investors constituting over USD 22 trillion in AUM use GRESB data to monitor their investments, engage with their managers, and make decisions that lead to a more sustainable real asset industry. Following GRESB’s change in ownership, an independent, non-profit foundation – the GRESB Foundation – will be incorporated to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the Assessments are based. Contact: gresb.com/contact About PCAF PCAF is a global, industry-led initiative of financial institutions that work together to develop and implement a harmonized approach to assess and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with loans and investments, known as financed emissions. Currently, over 100 financial institutions have committed to the initiative. In November 2020, PCAF published the first-ever Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for Financial Industry, which covers the financed emissions of loans and investments in commercial real estate, mortgages, and various other asset classes. PCAF collaborates with several organizations, institutions, and coalitions, including CDP, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA). Contact: [email protected] About CRREM The Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) project, originally funded by the EU 2020 Horizon programme, has derived decarbonization pathways that translate the ambitions of the Paris Agreement (to limit global warming to 2°C with ambition to 1.5°C by the end of the century) into regionally- and property-type-specific trajectories against which real estate assets and portfolios can benchmark themselves. These pathways, while primarily alignment tools, may also be used as proxies for “transition risk” (in this case, the risk of assets being stranded due to regulatory incompliance or market obsolescence) insofar as the covered nations follow similar decarbonization strategies. CRREM’s scope now covers the majority of global real estate markets, and residential as well as commercial real estate. These pathways are finalized and publicly available.

TCFD A recent paper from Zurich on the quality and content of the growing number of climate-related disclosures from TCFD-supporting firms comes to “the sobering conclusion that the firms’ TCFD support is mostly cheap talk and that firms cherry-pick to report primarily non-material climate risk information.” This corroborates the growing importance of standardized TCFD reporting. With the TCFD-aligned integration of the Resilience Module complete, GRESB is exploring the case for structured and transparent TCFD reports that leverage the GRESB process of standardizing, validating, and benchmarking data to provide our Members with clear, concise, and actionable insights on how entities are handling climate-related issues. Transition Risk Tool As commitments around Net Zero continue to pick up steam in the financial industry, an understanding of Paris-alignment and transition risk has never been more important.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/the-evolution-of-real-asset-resilience/,The Evolution of Real Asset Resilience,"Resilience Insights Series: Part 1 The GRESB Resilience Module was launched in 2018 in an effort to evaluate the data that would provide investors and fund managers alike with an understanding of how resilience is considered within real asset investment processes. Over the 3-year lifecycle of the Module — from designing the indicators, engaging with stakeholders, discussing with our governance groups, and analyzing and contextualizing Module results — GRESB has learned a lot about resilience in general. Furthermore, we’ve developed an understanding of how our Participants think about resilience and how to collect the most relevant data in a way that can be expressed clearly to our Members. In its inaugural year, the Resilience Module was completed by 121 Real Estate entities and 37 Infrastructure Asset entities. In its final year of 2020, participation in the Module had grown to 412 Real Estate entities, 98 Infrastructure Asset entities, and 28 Infrastructure Fund entities, representing roughly 34%, 23%, and 24% of total GRESB participation for the GRESB Assessments, respectively. This rapid uptake mirrors the growth in investor awareness and interest in real asset resilience and climate-related issues. It also suggests that much of the market is still in the early stages of its collective approach to these, perhaps daunting, issues. The Resilience Module has been discontinued in 2021, as its most useful and insightful elements have been incorporated into the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. We are excited to integrate the most evolved resilience indicators into our Assessments in pursuit of our mission to provide standardized, validated, and benchmarked data to the capital markets, and contributing to our collective progress toward a more sustainable real asset sector and, by extension, a more sustainable world. This Resilience Insights series is meant to serve three main purposes. Firstly, to put our learnings over the past three years into context and provide an orientation of how they guided the integration of climate-related resilience into the main Assessments. Secondly, to provide expert commentary on subjects core to the understanding of resilience, particularly as it relates to real assets. And thirdly, to disseminate high-level output/insights from the final iteration of the Resilience Module. The Resilience Insights series will unfold as follows: Article 1 provides a brief background on the GRESB Resilience Module, an introduction to the series, and three high-level lessons learned from the Resilience Module lifecycle Article 2 will explore the concept of climate risk and how it relates to climate resilience Article 3 will explore best practices and what effective organizational leadership looks like in terms of resilience Article 4 will explore the concept of resilient business strategy and its operationalization into effective risk management Article 5 will explore the concept of social risk, its nascent status within institutional understanding, and provide context to users who may have struggled with the category in hopes of advancing the ESG conversation Resilience as a general concept has been around for quite some time. However, the financial industry’s interest in resilience, and how it might be used as an indicator of market outperformance, is more recent. And with its entrance into this new “market,” the term resilience is still going through the growing pains experienced by any new buzzword: overuse, mis-use, oversimplification, over-correction, etc. Transparency is key in sorting through market confusion. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. In an effort to promote critical dialogue, we propose to explore a central dichotomy: resilience as a state or resilience as a process. Resilience as a state — as understood in the question “is your asset/portfolio resilient?” — raises the question: resilient to what? Resilient to climate change? Resilient to hurricanes? Wildfires? Pandemics? Cyber-attacks? This is quickly followed by the question: resilient to what degree? Resilience to storm surges of 1 meter? What about 2 meters? How about tsunamis? We see that resilience as a state is not an easy claim to make without a significant amount of scoping. Resilience as a process is no less of a challenge to wrangle. While it might evade the absolutism of resilience as a state by only dealing with its more relative nature, it nevertheless comes with its own set of perhaps even more difficult questions. Does a process promote or degrade the qualities generally associated with resilience? How quickly does an organization respond to change? How quickly and completely might it recover when it experiences a situation in which it takes damage or loses value, as it almost inevitably will? And critically, how can indicators of process be designed in ways that strongly correlate with an organization’s ability to be resilient to the wide range of potential climate impacts and opportunities as they actually occur? GRESB traditionally hints at processes rather than end states. We provide a standardized benchmark for ESG considerations to the extent the information is captured about the existence of an ESG policy or the scope of a process. As such, we take a similar approach with regard to resilience. While we have taken pains to scope the relevant issues as much as possible, we have tried to capture a portrait of resilience with the paints of a process’ existence, scope, quality, and decision-making strength. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has provided financial markets with a framework for the clear, comparable, and relevant communication of climate-related issues to financial actors. It’s use of the term ‘resilience’ in the context of climate change has given the term a more defined and approachable scope. Firstly, the TCFD’s acknowledgment of resilience as an opportunity in the face of climate-related risks positions resilience as more of a dynamic process of developing rather than a static threshold of post-development. “The concept of climate resilience involves organizations developing adaptive capacity to respond to climate change to better manage the associated risks and seize opportunities, including the ability to respond to transition risks and physical risks. Opportunities include improving efficiency, designing new production processes, and developing new products. Opportunities related to resilience may be especially relevant for organizations with long-lived fixed assets or extensive supply or distribution networks; those that depend critically on utility and infrastructure networks or natural resources in their value chain; and those that may require longer-term financing and investment.” Secondly, the TCFD’s use of resilience in its recommended disclosure Strategy (c) infers that same action-oriented understanding of resilience. “Describe the resilience of the organization’s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario.” You’ll notice that the recommended disclosure does not read “Describe whether or not the organization’s strategy is resilient…” Finally, the way resilience is used throughout the TCFD report allows us to use the TCFD structure itself as a useful framework for thinking about climate resilience. In the same way that climate-related issues should be disclosed in a way that it addresses elements of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets, reporting on climate resilience can leverage a similar structure. Thus, the four pillars of the TCFD provide a comprehensive lens to view climate-related resilience. This does not mean that risks associated with social elements are not real or not important. On the contrary, vast evidence demonstrates that low-income communities, communities of color, low-wage workers, isolated populations and many others are at greater risk because they already lack the resources to respond to climate impacts or to recover from disasters. It is essential for capital to flow in ways that support local communities. However, this requirement is generally seen as a priority for public policy instead of capital. Financial interests alone are unlikely to direct sufficient resources into underserved communities, as returns are often perceived to be more limited. Few mechanisms exist to allow investors to directly capitalize on social co-benefits, although programs and funds are emerging to help investors do just that. Our experience with the concept of social risk within the Resilience Module helped us understand its challenges and shaped our decisions for the future. Social risk, as it evolved throughout the course of the Resilience Module, tended to be a catch-all of everything that did not fall into the well-defined categories of transition risk and physical risk. The initial version of the Resilience Module (2018) looked at a broad range of disruptions and asked companies to consider risk from what, and to whom? The alignment with TCFD meant that the “to whom” question no longer fit and was therefore placed into a separate section. This created confusion, as social dimensions of risk cannot be separated cleanly from physical or transition risks. Various transition risks and physical risks were even at times portrayed as social risks in an effort to address all three categories. Without a clearer understanding of what social risk entails, the category lost its utility in its primary purpose of informing the identification, assessment, and management of those risks. Furthermore, while the TCFD provided a framework for translating transition and physical risks into impacts, no such widely understood and accepted framework is yet available for the translation of social risks. Without such a framework, the identification, assessment, and management of social risks, while no less important, are not as easily communicated to, or accessible by, investors attempting to build resilience into their decision-making processes and overall strategies. Finally, GRESB already captures a strong foundation of data on various aspects relating to social capability, performance, objectives, and management within its core Assessments. The building of such capabilities may indeed lead to more resilient entities. The “S” in ESG continues to be a core element on which GRESB seeks to provide actionable insights. The articles in this series on lessons learned from the Resilience Module will provide insights on what was revealed from results over the last three years. Notably, it will illustrate key concepts and what best practice looks like. The goal is to keep advancing the state of practice by helping investors to ask better questions and demonstrating what good answers look like.

The index boosts the specialist offering of the parent GLIO Index, whose principles are to capture companies engaged in activities critical for the day-to-day functioning of society and the global economy. The index arrives at a key juncture, when investors are increasingly aware of the importance of coherent climate and ESG goals. It will: Expand upon the parent GLIO Index Use GRESB’s annual infrastructure Public Disclosure scores to weight constituents Be managed by global real assets index specialist GPR, registered under EU Benchmark Regulations (BMR) To enter the GLIO index, companies must derive 75% of EBITDA from the following infrastructure groups: Energy Transportation & Storage, Communications Infrastructure, Transportation, Renewable Energy and Regulated Network Utilities. The GLIO Index eligible infrastructure sectors are based on the broader industry standard EDHECInfra TICCS® classification system. The GRESB Public Disclosure offers investors a unique tool to evaluate the transparency of sustainability disclosures as seen on the websites, sustainability reports and annual reports of infrastructure companies in the GLIO Index. The evaluation covers: sustainability governance, sustainability implementation, operational performance data, and stakeholder engagement practices. Each constituent is scored on the above areas and the scores combined are applied in a 10% banding system to calculate a final weight in the index. Scores are updated in November on an annual basis. The GLIO/GRESB ESG Index can serve as the basis for institutional asset mandates and exchange traded funds (ETFs). In addition, GPR has 25 years-experience in index customization which enables investors to tailor their investment strategies while using the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index as the backbone. The index also provides an essential tool for investors to engage with constituent companies on improving public disclosure and transparency going forward. The GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is the first ESG focused index in the listed infrastructure space. Manoj Patel, Chairman of the GLIO Index Committee, said: “The launch of the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is leap forward in the sophistication of the asset class, aimed at encouraging better ESG disclosure. We see this as a move towards better ESG engagement with companies, enabling investors to benchmark through an ESG lens.” Manoj Patel, Chairman of the GLIO Index Committee, said: “The launch of the GLIO/GRESB ESG Index is leap forward in the sophistication of the asset class, aimed at encouraging better ESG disclosure.

Mindful of this, 2021 Assessments changes will be incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and continue to support the move to a greater emphasis on ESG performance and outcomes over the next few years. Our focus has been on standardising reporting, increasing alignment with external frameworks and regulations, improving reporting efficiencies and quality control, and strengthening our analytical capabilities to deliver more ESG insights from the existing dataset. 2021 Infrastructure Assessments The 2021 Infrastructure Assessments have already been made available in pre-release. The (TCFD aligned) Resilience Module, which was previously optional, has been integrated in the Management Components of the Fund and Asset Assessments. New metrics have been added to the Asset Performance Component based on alignment with other frameworks and input from stakeholders. The full Reference Guide and Scoring Document will be released on March 1, 2021. Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-release Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-release 2021 Real Estate Assessment The 2021 Real Estate Assessment Pre-release will be made available on March 1, together with the Reference Guide and Scoring Document, following feedback from Assessment participants and consultation with the Real Estate Advisory Board and regional Benchmark Committees. As with previous years, the Assessment Portal will open on April 1, marking the start of the 2021 reporting period. See the 2021 Assessment timeline. With the world waking up to the need to rapidly transition to a more sustainable and resilient future, the interest in ESG data and benchmarks is intensifying. As stewards of the global ESG benchmarks for the real asset industry, our role is to ensure our members have access to reliable and comparable ESG data and benchmarks to understand the sustainability performance of their assets and portfolios; communicate, engage and coordinate effectively; and ultimately make decisions that lead to positive social and environmental outcomes. We are developing a long-term strategy in consultation with the industry to guide our collective effort. The initial steps for this work are set out below. These will weave into the activities of the GRESB Foundation, which is due to become fully operational by April 2021. The Foundation will govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based, ensuring they remain independent and reflective of the industry and members they represent.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-2020-with-crisis-comes-opportunity/,GRESB Newsletter | 2020: With crisis comes opportunity,"2020: With crisis comes opportunity Amid all the disruption and uncertainty of the year, we witnessed a great upswing in ESG transparency and collaboration from across the real asset industry. ESG issues are nothing new of course, but the crisis has intensified them and underlined how critical it is to build resilience for systemic problems like the climate crisis, social inequality, and biodiversity loss. 2020 also saw regulators taking up the ESG baton like never before, and investors demanding ever more granular, standardised and validated data to enhance their risk management and investment processes. These forces have the power to align the markets with the ecological, social and economic systems on which they depend, and ultimately shape a more sustainable and resilient world. This is the opportunity we are planning for and we are committed to doing our part to support the industry through these historic times. Following last month’s announcement about the changes to GRESB’s governance, we are in the final stages of setting up the GRESB Foundation as a legal entity. We recognize the importance of working closely with all our stakeholders over the next few months to ensure we establish the right structures and engagement processes under the Foundation. This design stage is crucial and the intention is for the GRESB Foundation to become fully operational by April 2021, with the right arrangements in place in time to oversee the development of the 2022 GRESB Standards. The existing Advisory Bodies and Benchmark Committees will remain in place in the interim period to oversee the release of the 2021 Assessments. We have published the 2021 Assessments timeline on gresb.com. The key milestones include: December 2020: 2021 Infrastructure Assessments Pre-release March: 2021 Real Estate Assessment Pre-release April 1: GRESB Portal opens July 1: Portal closes September 1: Preliminary release of 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Results September: Results Review Period October 1: Release 2021 Real Estate and Infrastructure Results October: Public results events As this year draws to a close we would like to offer you our best wishes for the holiday season and thank you for all your collaboration, insight and support for our work in 2020. Kind regards,GRESB The 2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments are available in Pre-release The 2021 Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and input from our governance groups. This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps to move the entire industry closer to a shared vision of sustainable real assets. The 2021 Assessment changes will provide further alignment with external frameworks, enable us to enhance our analytical tools and support our efforts to improve the quality of the ESG data available to the industry. 2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Pre-release2021 Assessment Development Process The upcoming EU regulations are a significant development for the real assets sector. The most important regulations are the EU Taxonomy (EU-T), the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). These regulations will require a step change from the industry in terms of transparency as it pertains to environmental, social and governance criteria and the need for more aligned, comprehensive and quality ESG reporting. GRESB is committed to helping its members address these regulations. GRESB recognises that these new regulations represent a challenge to the industry and that GRESB Members and Partners have considerable expertise in addressing such challenges. We therefore invite Members and Partners to express their interest in collaborating on EU regulatory reporting and assessment. This is intended to be on a voluntary basis, with recognition provided for input.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2021-gresb-infrastructure-assessments-development/,2021 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Development,"GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real assets, providing standardized and validated data to capital markets. We were established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to reliable data on the ESG performance of their real estate investments. In 2015, a group of ten founding infrastructure investors came together to establish the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments. Since then GRESB has grown to become the leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. 2021 Assessments available in Pre-release: Download Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-release Download Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-release Following last month’s announcement about the changes to GRESB’s governance, we are in the final stages of setting up the independent GRESB Foundation to own and govern the GRESB Standards on which the Assessments are based. All GRESB Members and Partners will be part of the Foundation. The Foundation Board will have broad representation from across GRESB Investor Members to ensure that the Standards remain investor-led, mission-driven and responsive to investor needs. We recognize the importance of working closely with all our stakeholders over the next few months to ensure we establish the right structures and engagement processes under the Foundation. This design stage is crucial and the intention is for the GRESB Foundation to become fully operational by April 2021, with the right arrangements in place in time to oversee the development of the 2022 GRESB Standards. The existing Advisory Bodies and Benchmark Committees will remain in-place in the interim period to oversee the release of the 2021 Assessments, as outlined below. 2021 Assessments Development Process The annual Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and input from our governance groups as described conceptually in the figure below. This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps to move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. April – November 2020: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved: Mapping ESG topics and metrics covered by other reporting standards and frameworks relevant to our stakeholders; Identifying areas of potential alignment between those topics and our Assessment; Reviewing and analysing the current responses to all indicators; Reviewing feedback provided by participants; Reviewing which indicators and metrics were of limited analytical value or of limited interest to investors, and evaluating whether these would be kept or amended. October 2020 – December 2020: Engagement with our governance groups, the Infrastructure Advisory Board and the Infrastructure Benchmark Committee, to discuss the proposed changes and to generate further input into the Assessments. December 2020: Incorporating the final comments and publishing the pre-release of the 2021 Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments. Mindful of how the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments have developed over the last five years, changes this year are incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and ready to support the move to a greater focus on performance over the next few years. The Resilience Module, which was previously optional, has been integrated in the Management Components of the Fund and Asset Assessments and is aligned with TCFD reporting. New metrics have been added to the Asset Performance Component based on alignment with other frameworks and input from stakeholders. The Fund Assessment will still consist of a Management Component only, with the scores of the fund’s underlying assets informing the fund’s performance score. The Asset Assessment will comprise a Management and Performance Component. The 2021 Assessment changes will provide further alignment with external frameworks, enable us to enhance our analytical tools and support our efforts to improve the quality of the ESG data available to the industry. Infrastructure Fund The Fund Assessment has been reviewed and the Resilience Module has been integrated. As in 2020, the Fund Assessment will consist of a Management Component, called the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund, which is aligned to the Asset Assessment’s Management Component – Infrastructure Asset. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Fund will simply comprise the Asset Assessments for the underlying assets. The Management Component – Infrastructure Fund consists of five aspects: Leadership Policies Reporting Risk Management Stakeholder Engagement New indicators have been added in the Risk Management aspect as part of the Resilience integration. These new indicators will not be scored in 2020. Two indicators in the Leadership aspect have been adapted to suit the Resilience integration. For alignment reasons, some metrics have been added, changed or removed. Funds completing the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund will obtain a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Fund. If more than 25% of their underlying assets complete both the Asset Management and Performance Components, the average aggregated GRESB Scores for those assets will provide the Performance Component Score for the Infrastructure Fund. Infrastructure Asset The Resilience Module has also been integrated into the Asset Assessment’s Management Component. As in the 2020 Assessments, the Management Component will focus on management and processes and be pitched at the organizational level. The Performance Component will focus on measuring performance, include performance indicators and certifications and be pitched at the asset level. The Management Component is suitable for any type of infrastructure company, asset and investment strategy. It is validated, scored and peer-benchmarked using the globally recognized GRESB methodology, and can be completed individually or in combination with the Performance Components. The Management Component – Infrastructure Asset consists of five aspects. The aspects align with the Fund Assessment; Leadership Policies Reporting Risk Management Stakeholder Engagement Several indicators were amended, from slight name changes, added or removed metrics, to changes to the structure of indicators. New indicators were added to the Risk Management aspect as part of the Resilience integration. These new indicators will not be scored in 2021. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset comprises twelve aspects: Implementation Output & Impact Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions Air Pollution Water Waste Biodiversity & Habitat Health & Safety Employees Customers Certifications & Awards As part of the process to score performance in addition to transparency, the aspect Output & Impact has been made mandatory for any assets completing the Performance Component. This enables GRESB to provide intensity metrics for the quantitative indicators in the Performance Component. New metrics have been added to some of the indicators to align with external frameworks. None of the new metrics are scored. 2021 Pre-Release The 2021 Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments are available in pre-release versions here. While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2021 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2021 Infrastructure Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications."

Here are the latest updates: Last week, we made an exciting announcement about our future covering three important changes to GRESB. First, we are establishing an independent GRESB Foundation to own and govern the GRESB Standards on which the Assessments are based. All GRESB members and partners will be part of the Foundation. The Foundation Board will have broad representation from across GRESB Investor Members to ensure that the Standards remain investor-led, mission-driven and responsive to investor needs. The existing Real Estate and Infrastructure Advisory Boards and Benchmark Committees (renamed as Standards Boards and Standards Committees respectively) will be formalized under the governance of the Foundation and continue to oversee the development and maintenance of the Standards. We aim to have the GRESB Foundation, and its governance and committees, in place by year end 2020. Second, GRESB BV will become a benefit corporation and seek formal B-Corp certification to ensure accountability for our mission over the long term. We will move to a dual board governance structure with a Supervisory Board and Management Board. The Supervisory board will guide the Management Board and ensure we fulfil our mission. Third, supported by our investment partner, Summit Partners, we will invest in our data science and technology capabilities, expand the benchmark coverage and improve our processes so that we can better support our members and partners in their reporting efforts. ​​​​Read the announcement We’re pleased to announce that 2020 GRESB results for Infrastructure and Real Estate are now out. We would like to congratulate all our members and partners for taking part in the benchmark and thank all our stakeholders for their support and collaboration as we worked through the challenges of this year’s results release period.

The Public Disclosure Levels (ranked from A to E) are now available in the GRESB Portal. GRESB Investor Members use this data to compare the ESG transparency of listed companies. It is also being used by a growing number of ESG indices using GRESB data, including the new GLIO/GRESB INDEX, the first specialist global listed infrastructure ESG focused index being launched later this year. This year’s Sustainable Investing Report from Infrastructure Investor considers how covid-19 could be the catalyst for a green future; how to promote good governance; and looks at LPs leading the climate change charge – plus much more. Rick Walters, GRESB’s Director Infrastructure wrote an article for the report commenting on the readiness of the Infrastructure asset class for the coming EU regulations.

The GRESB team would like to thank GBCI for the support it has provided over the last six years to advance sustainable real assets and for allowing us to take this next step in our journey. This new ownership allows us to establish an independent, non-profit foundation – the GRESB Foundation (or “Foundation”) – to own and govern the GRESB Standards upon which the GRESB Assessments are based. The Foundation Board will be constituted from GRESB Investor Members and will be responsible for reviewing and approving the Standards on an annual basis to ensure they remain investor-led and aligned with responsible investment principles. “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by industry, for industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization. I look forward to serving on the Foundation Board alongside my former GRESB non-executive director colleagues – Deborah Ng, Head of Responsible Investing and Director, Total Fund Management, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and Mathieu Elshout Senior Director Private Real Estate, PGGM Investments – and other members.” “We welcome the establishment of a truly independent GRESB Foundation to govern the GRESB Standards and continue their development as investor needs evolve,” said Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets, APG Asset Management. “This is an important evolution to reinforce that GRESB is a by industry, for industry, mission-driven and investor-led organization.

GRESB BV will continue to be responsible for administering the GRESB Assessments, providing the benchmarks, promoting widespread adoption of the GRESB Standards and supporting investor and participant members. GRESB BV will become a benefit corporation and seek formal B-Corp certification, in order to build accountability for our mission into our legal structure and to protect this accountability over the long term. Enabled by the capital commitment from our investment partner, we will grow our team in emerging markets and add more capacity to support participants with their reporting efforts. We will further invest in our data science and technology capabilities to uncover new ESG insights essential to sustainable investment decision making and to ensure the quality and reliability of the benchmark results. With sound governance around the GRESB Standards, clearer accountability around our mission, and fresh investment into the GRESB platform, we are ready to embark on a new era of ESG performance assessment and benchmarking. This work will further standardize ESG data for the capital markets, enhance the management of sustainability risks, opportunities and impacts, and accelerate the growth of responsible investment. “Thank you to so many of you who have been supporters of GRESB throughout our 10-year journey so far.” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director, GRESB. “We’re looking ahead to a new era for GRESB with deeper industry involvement in our governance and greater capacity to deliver the ESG data and insights needed to navigate the transition to sustainable real assets at the speed and the scale that is now required.” “Thank you to so many of you who have been supporters of GRESB throughout our 10-year journey so far.” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director, GRESB. “We’re looking ahead to a new era for GRESB with deeper industry involvement in our governance and greater capacity to deliver the ESG data and insights needed to navigate the transition to sustainable real assets at the speed and the scale that is now required.” ABOUT GRESB GRESB was established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to comparable and reliable data on the ESG performance of their investments.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2020-results-infrastructure-sector-maturing-its-approach-to-esg-reporting-and-benchmarking/,GRESB 2020 Results: Infrastructure sector maturing its approach to ESG reporting and benchmarking,"AMSTERDAM, (November 12, 2020): GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2020 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. Despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 crisis, participation has increased again in 2020 as the sector responds to the growing investor demand for standardized and validated ESG data to monitor the sustainability of their infrastructure funds and assets. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew to 75 funds completing both components – obtaining a GRESB Fund Score reflecting overall ESG performance at the portfolio level – and 118 completing the Management Component. The Assessment now covers 32% of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers, and 38% of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50 – participating with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment increased by 8% to cover 426 assets and 1,354 facilities. The Assessment now covers 32 of the 33 industry sectors across 59 countries, leading to deep data insights for investors, fund managers and asset operators. The Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset provides comprehensive coverage of listed infrastructure companies including the GLIO Global Coverage Index (234 companies in total). The data reveals which listed infrastructure companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which perform in the mid-range and which are lagging their peers. In an exciting new development, this data will be used in a GLIO/GRESB Index to be launched by year end. 98 assets and 28 funds participated in the Resilience Module (a 60% increase). The module is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The continued growth in participation demonstrates an increasing investor attention on climate risks and resilience. The big news this year is the leap in scores for both Funds and Assets. Overall GRESB Scores, and Component Scores, increased by 10 to 15 points on average. Only two funds saw their scores decrease. Funds are improving so much that thirteen funds scored the maximum 100 for the Management Component. In the case of Assets, for the first time in GRESB history (including Real Estate), one asset scored a maximum 100 for their overall GRESB Score. This shows that the industry is maturing in its approach to ESG and is strongly focused on improving performance. GRESB Fund Model (Component Scores) GRESB Asset Model (Component Scores) 75 funds participated in the Assessment with more than 25% of their assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score, which is the overall measure of ESG performance at the portfolio level. The average GRESB Fund Score increased to 65 points, from 55 in 2019. The average score also increased in the Asset Assessment, from 48 in 2019 to 61 in 2020. Participation was stable across most sectors in the Asset Assessment, but notably Data Infrastructure grew from 21 to 38 – likely reflecting the growing importance of this sector during the Covid crisis. The best-scoring sector continues to be Network Utilities (with an average score of 73), closely followed by Power Generation x-Renewables (72) and Renewable Power (69). While Social Infrastructure came in with the lowest average score again this year (47), it also posted one of the largest score increases (+18), narrowing the gap with other sectors. The scores for the two energy generation sectors (Power Generation x-Renewables and Renewable Power) showed the biggest increases (+25 and +20 respectively). There are clear regional differences in participation rates and performance. Europe-focused funds are the largest contingent, followed by Globally Diversified. Europe also has the largest number of participating assets (60%), but the lowest average asset score (57). Average scores across Americas, Asia and Oceania are all similar at around 67. “Now in its fifth year, we are delighted to see the maturing of the infrastructure industry in its approach to ESG, and focus on improving performance. Despite the clear challenges presented by the Covid-19 crisis, participation in GRESB still grew, and scores leapt by 10 to 15 points on average for both Funds and Assets. We even saw a GRESB first achieved, with one asset achieving a GRESB score of the maximum 100! We acknowledge the extra challenges faced this year, and we thank the new and returning participants for their diligence and commitment to reporting and engaging on ESG.” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We look forward to supporting our participant and investor members to use their benchmark results to support the transformation towards sustainable infrastructure. Infrastructure development is proving a strong feature of pandemic recovery plans across the globe, and proper integration of ESG in infrastructure investment provides the best assurance that the recovery will be effective and fair. It will enable issues like climate change and inequality to be addressed so that as we come out of this crisis, we are on our way to addressing and preventing the next, and building a better and fairer world.” “Now in its fifth year, we are delighted to see the maturing of the infrastructure industry in its approach to ESG, and focus on improving performance.

You can also read the article below. New data streams providing asset-level intelligence are revolutionising sustainable finance in the real estate sector, but there is still a critical need for more harmonisation and benchmarking when it comes to ESG data. That was the main message from experts gathered for the third annual (and this time digital) Nordea GRESB Green Building Forum on September 25. The event drew in over 100 participants, bringing together leading investors, real estate companies and other market experts to discuss the substantial shift currently underway in real estate financing. The real estate sector both affects and is affected by climate change. It is responsible for a large share of global greenhouse gas emissions, roughly 40% when considering both direct and indirect emissions, according to Marco Kisic, Head of ESG Research at Nordea. The industry will have to undergo a “very significant” transformation in order to meet the targets set forth in the Paris Agreement, he told the audience. In Europe, a host of regulations and policies are driving that change, from the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive and the EU Green Deal to the EU Sustainability Taxonomy. “By starting to act now and plan ahead, companies have the opportunity to get ahead of the competition and get in a strong position before regulation is even tighter than where it is now,” Kisic said. “By starting to act now and plan ahead, companies have the opportunity to get ahead of the competition and get in a strong position before regulation is even tighter than where it is now,” Kisic said. The experts presenting at the forum made it clear that a strong ESG performance can influence corporate performance. In one breakout session, Anna Denell, Head of Sustainability at Swedish real estate company Vasakronan, presented four compelling reasons why real estate companies should focus on ESG performance: Lowering your environmental and climate impact typically leads to saved resources, which usually means saved money. Certified green buildings are easier to lease, often offering benefits such as improved air quality, reduced noise and better light, which can help attract and retain tenants. Appraisers have started to implement a yield shift for certified assets. Going green is the best way to lower the price of your funding. Denell noted that Vasakronan currently has 85% of its assets certified. Presenters from S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service also shed light on how ESG factors are incorporated into their frameworks for corporate credit ratings in real estate. Manish Kejriwal from S&P noted that environmental credit factors are becoming increasingly relevant, affecting such parameters as asset quality, business strategy as well as cash flow and profitability. When asked about the quality of the ESG data he has to work with when assessing credit ratings, Kejriwal described the current state of disclosure as inadequate. “Companies are disclosing data, but key performance indicators are missing,” he said, pointing to value chain data as one missing component. “Companies are disclosing data, but key performance indicators are missing,” he said, pointing to value chain data as one missing component. Part of the problem with ESG data is that only a relatively small percentage of real assets are certified and that the certifications are so different, according to Nordea’s Kisic. He noted that companies have made massive strides over the past 10 years when it comes to ESG disclosures, particularly in the Nordics, but there is still ground to cover, and a gap persists between large and small caps. As part of Nordea’s Taxonomy work, Kisic has tried to map the different certifications available in the Nordics to the criteria in the EU Sustainability Taxonomy, an exercise Kisic described as “incredibly complicated.” “We’re going to need some unification going forward. The Taxonomy is hopefully a first step in that direction,” he said. “We’re going to need some unification going forward. The Taxonomy is hopefully a first step in that direction,” he said. Since its founding over 10 years ago, GRESB has been driving a collaborative effort to define standardized metrics and develop a consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance of real assets. In the past, GRESB only gathered data at the portfolio level from asset managers and passed that along to investors. Five years ago, the organisation started looking at the underlying, asset-level data. In 2020, reporting on such asset-level data became mandatory for all GRESB participants. Those disclosures are used to inform the data that’s passed on to institutional investors. The GRESB database now covers around 96,000 assets and includes specific data on criteria such as building certifications, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, water and waste. “Once the data comes together in a structured way, we will be able to make some meaningful conclusions at a structural level,” said Josien Piek, Head of EMEA at GRESB and a co-host of the event. “Once the data comes together in a structured way, we will be able to make some meaningful conclusions at a structural level,” said Josien Piek, Head of EMEA at GRESB and a co-host of the event. For companies that report their asset-level data to GRESB, that data can be easily integrated with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology, which breaks down high-level Paris Agreement goals into country-level, sub-sector and building-specific carbon transition pathways. “It’s revolutionary that the business community is now picking up something that’s a collective goal and doing it in a diligent and fast manner,” Piek added. “It’s revolutionary that the business community is now picking up something that’s a collective goal and doing it in a diligent and fast manner,” Piek added. In one breakout session, Derk Welling, Senior Responsible Investment & Governance Specialist at APG Asset Management, explained how pension manager APG has adopted the strategy of looking for more detailed certified asset-level data, imposing BREEAM In-Use certification across its complete portfolio in Europe for non-listed investments. “A green certification scheme means to us that the environmental performance has been measured against a certain standard. And since each BREEAM certificate comes with over 100 questions, we indirectly can get access to a lot of additional asset-level data,” he said. “A green certification scheme means to us that the environmental performance has been measured against a certain standard. And since each BREEAM certificate comes with over 100 questions, we indirectly can get access to a lot of additional asset-level data,” he said. The regulatory landscape around ESG data is also rapidly evolving. Bahar Yay Celik from INREV presented the ins and outs of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, set to take effect in Europe in March 2021 with the aim of reorienting capital towards sustainable investment. The regulation covers financial market participants and financial advisors; companies with more than 500 employees and all firms that market funds into the EU, requiring both entity and product-level disclosures. The legislation is expected to indirectly have a global impact on the whole value chain. Jacob Michaelsen, Head of Sustainable Finance Advisory at Nordea and co-host of the event, summed up the main takeaways from the day: “Today’s forum makes it clear that to really supercharge the shift currently underway, we need harmonisation on ESG data and benchmarking as well as regulation that supports that.” Jacob Michaelsen, Head of Sustainable Finance Advisory at Nordea and co-host of the event, summed up the main takeaways from the day: “Today’s forum makes it clear that to really supercharge the shift currently underway, we need harmonisation on ESG data and benchmarking as well as regulation that supports that.” Watch the recording from the event: Information on the Breakout room videos:Breakout 1 Asset owner perspective on working with ESG data (Derk Welling, Senior Responsible Investment Specialist at APG Asset Management) – Included in the video above at minute 1:21:46Breakout 2: Asset manager perspective on working with ESG data (Anna Denell, Sustainability Director, Vasakronan) – Available here: https://youtu.be/uQXzlH7kGdc Breakout 3: Technical perspective on asset-level ESG data (Erik Landry, Climate Change Specialist, GRESB) – Available here: https://youtu.be/NmNOGgiKdSo Read more from Nordea: https://insights.nordea.com/en/"

The Asia Pacific Embodied Carbon Primer raises awareness on what embodied carbon is, where it occurs throughout a building and infrastructure asset’s lifecycle and how tackling embodied carbon can catalyse Asia Pacific to building back better post COVID-19. It sets out key actions that can be taken today by business, government and civil society to raise awareness, set ambitions, drive demand and make substantial progress in reducing embodied carbon of projects, materials and products. 60% of the world’s population currently live in the Asia Pacific region and the region is projected to have significant growth and new buildings and infrastructure over the coming decades. It is also one of the world’s most vulnerable regions to climate change. Of the 4.3 billion people living in Asia Pacific, more than 2 billion live in urban areas. Projections show this will increase to 3.3 billion by 2050. With such a large projected growth, mitigating embodied carbon emissions over the coming years is essential to ensuring a high quality of life, minimising the negative impacts on the environment, and maximising economic opportunities to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly low carbon economy. Victoria Burrows, Director, Advancing Net Zero, World Green Building Council “In 2018 alone, almost half of the world’s 281 natural disaster events occurred in the Asia Pacific region including 8 of the 10 deadliest with an increasing number of these events being linked to environmental degradation and climate change. The built environment sector can provide powerful solutions to the climate crisis. With buildings responsible for 39% of global energy-related carbon emissions and building stock expected to double by 2050, the time to act is now. To achieve net zero targets by mid-century and sustain predicted growth and urbanisation, we must decarbonise the whole lifecycle of our built assets — buildings and infrastructure. If we act now, great opportunity awaits for Asia Pacific to create economic benefits, competitiveness advantage and minimise the consequences of catastrophic climate change.” “In 2018 alone, almost half of the world’s 281 natural disaster events occurred in the Asia Pacific region including 8 of the 10 deadliest with an increasing number of these events being linked to environmental degradation and climate change.

If we act now, great opportunity awaits for Asia Pacific to create economic benefits, competitiveness advantage and minimise the consequences of catastrophic climate change.” To truly tackle the climate crisis, the report calls for the building and construction sector to embrace a whole lifecycle approach to carbon emissions. This means not only the emissions released during operation (energy to heat, cool and power buildings) but also during the manufacturing, transportation, construction, maintenance, repair and end of life phases known as ‘embodied carbon’. These emissions contribute around 11% of all global energy-related carbon emissions and 28% of building sector emissions. The carbon emissions released before the building or infrastructure begins to be used, sometimes called upfront carbon, will be responsible for half of the entire carbon footprint of new construction between now and 2050, threatening to consume a large part of the world’s remaining carbon budget. Addressing embodied carbon in buildings and infrastructure can help build back better, reinforce the business case for net zero, renew tradition and encourage innovation, provide new forms of incentives and futureproof global competitiveness.Read the report on WorldGBC’s website.

This increase comes despite the pressures of the Covid-19 pandemic and is testament to an industry-wide commitment to ESG transparency and collaborative action on sustainability. The 2020 ESG benchmark now covers more than US $5.3 trillion AuM (2019: 4.5 trillion), giving clarity and direction to the real asset investment market as a means to address complex sustainability challenges. GRESB data is used by hundreds of capital providers and thousands of asset managers to benchmark investments across portfolios and understand the opportunities, risks and choices that need to be made as the industry transitions to a more sustainable future. The benchmarks also provide an objective reference point on national and regional performance and help to track industry progress against normative guidelines such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals; decarbonization pathways such as those defined by Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) for the real estate sector and emerging disclosure regulations including the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the EU ESG Regulations. 1,229 (2019: 1,005) property companies, REITs, private equity funds and real estate developers participated in the 2020 Real Estate Assessment, generating a benchmark that covers US $4.8 trillion AuM (2019: 4.1 trillion). Data on key environmental performance indicators is reported at asset level and covers more than 96,000 assets, across 64 countries. The data combines high-level overall scores with in-depth information across hundreds of ESG metrics, including performance indicators such as energy consumption, GHG emissions, water consumption and waste. For private market investors, the GRESB benchmark covers 957 (2019: 723) non-listed funds, representing 79 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Global Real Estate Investment Managers who participate with at least one fund and 46 of PERE 100: institutional capital’s top manager picks. The listed dataset covers 272 (2019: 240) publicly-traded property companies and REITs globally, representing 61% coverage of the major developed listed real estate indices. Adding the GRESB Public Disclosure Dataset results in full coverage of the major listed real estate indices. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment increased by 10% to cover 118 funds (2019: 107) and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 8% to include 426 assets (2019: 393). The Infrastructure Benchmark now represents US $576 billion AuM (2019: 471 billion), covering 32 of the 34 industry sectors across 40 countries. To add market context to these numbers, 32% of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Infrastructure Investment Managers, and 38% of the Infrastructure Investor Top 50 participate in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment, with at least one portfolio or asset. And the Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset has full coverage of the GLIO Global Coverage Index (170 listed infrastructure companies with a US $2.7 trillion total market cap). 534 entities (comprising 408 real estate entities, 98 infrastructure assets, and 28 infrastructure funds) participated in the Resilience Module, a 69% increase from the previous year. This year marks the third and final year of the Resilience Module as a voluntary supplement for the Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. In 2021 the Resilience Module will be integrated into the core Assessments forming part of the required reporting set. The Module indicators, in coordination with the core Assessments, cover all TCFD recommendations helping investors to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and resilience efforts across real asset companies and funds around the world. “With accelerating sustainability risks, accessing standardized and reliable ESG data and benchmarks has never been more important to investors,” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets.” “With accelerating sustainability risks, accessing standardized and reliable ESG data and benchmarks has never been more important to investors,” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and advance sustainable real assets.” “We also owe a great debt to current and past members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today.” “We also owe a great debt to current and past members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today.” The transition to a sustainable real asset industry is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. It can only be met with reliable ESG information, meaningful global benchmarks and collective action from all stakeholders working towards a sustainable future. We hope you will join us for our online Public Results Events taking place the week beginning November 9, 2020, and thank you for being part of the movement.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-despite-covid-the-gresb-esg-benchmark-has-grown-again-this-year/,"GRESB Newsletter | Despite Covid, the GRESB ESG benchmark has grown again this year","The 2020 GRESB reporting period is over, and even during Covid, we are excited to announce that the number of GRESB Participants increased again this year. This is testament to all of the hard-working teams who collected the data, worked through the challenges, and coordinated the reporting. The 2020 Benchmark now covers more than US $5.3 trillion AuM (2019: US $4.5 trillion). Here’s a breakdown of the coverage: 2020 Real Estate Coverage: 1,229 (2019: 1,005) real estate portfolios participated in the Real Estate Assessment, a 22% increase compared to 2019. The Real Estate Benchmark now covers US $4.8 trillion AuM (2019: 4.1 trillion) with data reported for more than 96,000 individual assets across 64 countries. 2020 Infrastructure Coverage: The Infrastructure Fund Assessment increased by 10% to cover 118 funds (2019: 107) and the Infrastructure Asset Assessment grew by 8% to include 426 assets (2019: 393). The Infrastructure Benchmark now represents US $576 billion AuM (2019: 471 billion), covering 32 of the 34 industry sectors across 40 countries. 2020 Resilience Module Coverage: 534 entities (comprising 408 real estate entities, 98 infrastructure assets, and 28 infrastructure funds) participated in the Resilience Module, a 69% increase from the previous year. For more coverage information, please see our press release. The validation process conducted by GBCI is now underway. We estimate more than 38,000 (2019: 31,000) human validation decisions will be taken this year to ensure the quality of the reported data in preparation for scoring and benchmarking. This manual validation complements the automated checks on information completeness, accuracy and reporting rules integrated in the Portal. In parallel, the real estate team is conducting a reporting boundaries review to ensure portfolios have full coverage of their underlying assets. New this year, we have introduced a Review Period to further strengthen the reliability of the benchmark results. Participants can make official requests for validation and scoring reviews between October 1 – when their preliminary benchmark reports will be available – and October 15. Assessments and scores can then be updated until October 22. See the details of the Review Period The launch of final 2020 Assessment results and benchmarks, to both Participants and Investor Members, will take place on November 1. The public results events will follow a week later, starting November 9, 2020. These will be online and take place at different time zones to cover the main regions. Look out for more details on the program coming soon. We appreciate the time and effort it takes to collect the data and report to the Assessments. It’s your commitment to transparency and industry collaboration that is driving us forward towards a more sustainable future, both individually and collectively. Thank you for your efforts. Kind regardsGRESB The new “import entities” feature allows you to add a large number of entities at one time to the Portfolio Analysis Tool. Once added, you can quickly assign custom weights for your analysis. This feature will be particularly useful for Investor Members with a subscription to listed data. Investor Members can now request data access in batches, as well as entity-by-entity. We have added new filters to the report pages to help you select and focus on the information that is most useful. You can also now search for entities by GRESB Fund ID. The Industry Working Group brings together GRESB Members and subject-matter experts to help shape the reporting approach for Infrastructure Assets in development (undergoing design and construction). The group looks at specific ESG issues, materiality and scoring implications and how a framework to cover Infrastructure Assets in Development best fits alongside the existing Asset Assessment, with a view to implement this in 2021. The Industry Working Group met several times over 2019 and early 2020 and a further 2-3 video calls will be held over the next 6 months, with the first taking place in September 2020. Please get in touch if you are interested in participating, or if you have any questions. Current working group members do not need to reapply. A three month long public consultation has confirmed the approach taken for the CRREM decarbonisation pathways and the final pathways for the global real estate sector are now available. Pathways will be regularly updated to ensure that the latest climate and market data are leveraged as an underlying basis. The Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) recently released its Net Zero Investment Framework for consultation, in which it highlights the CRREM methodology and recommends its use to determine the alignment of real estate assets with a 1.5°C pathway. As a first stage, GRESB has automated the process of filling in the CRREM Tool with the asset-level performance data uploaded to the GRESB Asset Portal. This means that GRESB Real Estate Participants can already begin to leverage their asset-level reporting to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets against the CRREM pathways for the EU28. Later stages will have a broader scope, including the new global pathways and a greater integration of asset- and portfolio-level assessment capabilities into the GRESB Portal.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/public-consultation-confirmed-approach-of-crrem-decarbonisation-pathways-for-real-estate/,Public Consultation Confirmed Approach of CRREM-Decarbonisation Pathways for Real Estate,"Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) would like to thank all market participants who took part in the public consultation phase. Industry experts, investors and scientists provided feedback on the methodology, and gave consolidated statements on the decarbonisation pathways and their usefulness in understanding as well as managing long-term climate-related transition risk in the global real estate sector. The final CRREM decarbonisation pathways for the global real estate sector are now available on www.crrem.org. Pathways will be regularly updated in the future to ensure that the latest climate and market data are leveraged as an underlying basis. Feedback from market participants During the public consultation, the CRREM team has interacted with local players and industry experts globally to ensure credibility and robustness of both the underlying methodology and the data input. Responses were received from industry experts, local investors, asset managers, industry bodies, green building councils, consultants and other market participants. We thank all participants for their valuable input and support for CRREM. Interested parties challenged outcomes to ensure market acceptance and credibility. Particularly extensive perspectives and input were obtained for the USA, UK and Japan. All consultation feedback has been exhaustively reviewed and (if needed) implemented, ensuring alignment with industry expectations and scientific standards. Compared to the version released for consultation, the final version accounts for: Slight changes regarding starting figures for energy intensity based on additional data sources in some countries, the adoption of a more ambitious overall decarbonisation agenda in some markets and therefore more ambitious decarbonisation of energy sources over time (especially electricity), the methodology documentation was augmented, improved clarity and document structures, verification and utilization of additional country-specific sources. To date, major real estate investors like AEW, Alstria, Nordea Life & Pension, DWS, LEG, CBRE Global Investors, Castellum and many others have already successfully used and tested the CRREM tool and pathways. Investor interest in and uptake of CRREM outputs have rapidly increased due to the global outreach upon the finalization of the pathways, as well as their integration into GRESB. The upcoming release of the CRREM reporting templates and the public report “CRREM support to corporate reporting in the real estate sector” will further assist stakeholders in quantifying and disclosing climate-related risks in the real estate sector. Published results Following the public consultation period, the results have been published on the CRREM webpages. Market responses confirmed the methodology used to derive to the decarbonisation pathways, hence resulting in no material changes. The pathways will help market participants meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and other initiatives focussing on climate-related transition risk. The pathways published on the CRREM website identify annual energy- and carbon-intensity trajectories until 2050 across real estate markets and sectors that are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. CRREM covers the commercial real estate sector – including retail, offices, and logistics – as well as the residential sector, across North America, Asia-Pacific, and 28 countries in Europe. The final decarbonisation pathways for the global real estate sector will undergo revision periodically to ensure that new data sources are appropriately reflected and that the pathways remain valid and robust over time. Link to CRREM’s decarbonisation pathways Link to CRREM’s methodology Link to CRREM’s decarbonisation tool and further information CRREM participants The decarbonisation pathways were developed by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with technical support from GRESB. They were developed with the oversight of the newly instituted CRREM Scientific Advisory Committee, comprised of carefully selected academic experts with backgrounds in real estate and environmental sustainability across European, North American, and Asian markets.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/nikkei-inc-launches-a-green-reit-index-using-data-from-gresb/,Nikkei Inc. launches a green REIT Index using data from GRESB,"July 20, 2020: Nikkei Inc. has launched a new green real estate index, the “Nikkei ESG-REIT Index” which incorporates environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Responsible investment strategies are expanding globally with investors integrating ESG factors into listed real estate allocation processes. To meet this demand, Nikkei has developed a Japanese Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) index which takes ESG performance into account based on the GRESB Rating. Index constituents are selected from REITs listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and market capitalization weights are adjusted so that high-performing REITs have increased weights in the index. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB says: “GRESB supports investor demand for standardized and validated ESG performance data for real asset investments. One of the fastest growing markets for responsible investment in Asia is Japan, and most Japanese REITs report their ESG practices via the annual GRESB Assessment. The Nikkei ESG-REIT Index uses this data to track the performance of ESG leaders.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB says: “GRESB supports investor demand for standardized and validated ESG performance data for real asset investments. One of the fastest growing markets for responsible investment in Asia is Japan, and most Japanese REITs report their ESG practices via the annual GRESB Assessment. The Nikkei ESG-REIT Index uses this data to track the performance of ESG leaders.” The recent COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated existing ESG challenges such as the climate crisis, social inequality, and biodiversity loss. This has resulted in increased investor demand for ESG reporting and benchmarking to better manage risk, enhance returns and generate positive impact. “During the COVID-19 selloff, investors dramatically reduced their risk exposures, leading to increased inflows to listed equities that demonstrate strong ESG practices. In global equities, ESG leaders outperformed companies with poor ESG ratings by almost 7 percentage points in the first quarter of this year. It shows, once again, that responsible investment strategies provide an important protection to downside risk.” “During the COVID-19 selloff, investors dramatically reduced their risk exposures, leading to increased inflows to listed equities that demonstrate strong ESG practices.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/get-asset-specific-physical-climate-risk-exposure-data-and-benchmarks-in-the-gresb-portal/,Get asset-specific physical climate risk exposure data and benchmarks in the GRESB Portal,"We’ve just launched a new platform to provide you with physical climate risk exposure data directly in the GRESB Portal. Global geospatial risk provider Munich Re is first on the platform to provide asset-level intelligence across multiple climate scenarios and time frames. The physical impacts of a changing climate pose significant challenges to real assets. The chaotic nature of climatic patterns and increasing extremes — combined with the long lifetimes and limited mobility of real assets — mean that more uncertainty must be taken into account when making investment and development decisions. Understanding physical climate risks, from the asset level up, is crucial to implementing well-informed risk management practices and increasing the resilience of your portfolio. Munich Re, one of the world’s leading providers of insurance-related risk solutions, is the first data provider on the platform. Leveraging both extensive hazard databases and forward-looking climate models, Munich Re’s physical risk exposure data ranges from the present to 2100, across three different climate scenarios, at resolutions down to 30m. This flexibility and detail will help platform users to identify which of their assets are most exposed to physical climate risk, allow for long-term planning, and improve investment and development decisions. The GRESB Climate Risk Platform gives you a clear picture of portfolio exposure to a wide variety of physical climate risks. This information will help you: Identify which of your individual assets are most exposed Stress test your portfolio against multiple climate scenarios Plan for the long-term with multiple time horizons Report in line with TCFD recommendations Analyze assets for due diligence purposes When the 2020 GRESB Assessment results come out in the fall, you will be able to benchmark against peers as well as download custom reports. If you purchase climate risk data now, you’ll have the opportunity to be part of our Climate Risk Industry Working Group this summer to inform the additional analytics that will be available. The climate risk data is available for all real estate portfolios, including portfolios that do not participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. Login to the Portal to view the climate risk data. Learn more about the new GRESB Climate Risk Platform or get in touch with Erik Landry, GRESB’s Climate Change Specialist, at [email protected]."

Investors have been searching for guidance, transparency and quality in this area. This new ESG DD Tool helps establish a standard ESG due diligence process for infrastructure investing. For the purpose of the ESG DD Tool, the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment for benchmarking assets has been adapted to reflect the requirements of the M&A/Investment process. The ESG DD Tool is not tied to the GRESB Assessment cycle and can be used at any time. Considering ESG driven risks and opportunities (ESG factors) before investing will help investors make more informed investment decisions. Investors typically face the following challenges in ESG due diligence: lack of a structured process to identify all potential ESG factors, difficulty in identifying the material ESG factors for any given asset, quantification of the (material) ESG risks and opportunities, which can make or break the business case of an asset. The ESG DD Tool is open source. We invite the infrastructure and investment industry to provide feedback. GRESB and B Capital Partners will update the tool in response to feedback. Being Excel based, the tool can also be readily adapted by the user to meet his/her own due diligence needs.

The report contains insights about the state of the industry and practice from last year’s Resilience Module, leveraging a unique global dataset to provide a snapshot of the way real asset companies and funds are managing climate risk and resilience. The findings show that some firms have developed and executed relatively comprehensive programs, however, the majority of firms have partial or fragmented programs, often missing key elements, such as performance targets or operational metrics. The report covers the results from reporting real estate funds, infrastructure funds, and infrastructure assets, and breaks down the various ways in which funds are tackling the resilience challenge along the fronts of transition risk, physical risk, and social risk. It also analyzes the Module results across the four pillars used by the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Governance Strategy Risk Management Metrics & Targets This analysis provides insight into important areas for improvement, and the report provides seven actionable recommendations for investors and real asset companies working to materially improve their management of climate risk and resilience. Additional insights from the report include how leading real asset companies demonstrate innovation through a variety of resilience-related practices, which scenarios real asset firms are using to manage climate-related risks, and information on the distribution of resilience practices among top and bottom reporters. The results of this analysis have informed the development of the GRESB 2020 Resilience Module, which remains an optional supplement to the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-newsletter-a-collective-industry-effort-to-advance-sustainable-real-assets/,GRESB Newsletter | A collective industry effort to advance sustainable real assets,"A collective industry effort to advance sustainable real assets As you read this newsletter we are about one third of the way through the 2020 GRESB reporting season and the GRESB Portal is filling up with real estate and infrastructure managers completing their 2020 Assessments. It’s inspiring to witness the collective industry effort from around the world to improve ESG transparency and participate in an annual benchmarking process, especially at times like these. If you haven’t started your 2020 Assessment, it’s time to login to the Portal and get your reporting underway. We have extended the submission deadline by one month this year, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which means you have until August 1, 2020 to complete your Assessment. Here is the updated 2020 Assessment timeline. It’s been a busy few weeks for GRESB and we’re pleased to announce the first phase of integration of the CRREM Tool into the Asset Portal, the launch of the 2019 Resilience Module Report, translations for select videos in our online training portal and a new collaboration with the World Green Building Council. Real Estate Managers: You can now identify and manage transition risks for your individual assets using the CRREM Tool in the Asset Portal Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) provides the real estate industry with transparent, science-based decarbonisation pathways aligned with the Paris Climate Goals of limiting global temperature rise to 2°C, with ambition towards 1.5°C. These pathways enable industry stakeholders to estimate carbon risk exposure and potential strategies to reduce this risk, and include the elements needed to undertake scenario analysis. As such, CRREM can be used to comply with large-scale initiatives such as the Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities. The CRREM Risk Assessment Tool (CRREM Tool) is an Excel-based tool that allows users to analyse specific real estate assets, and portfolios of these assets, against the decarbonisation and energy pathways derived by the CRREM project. The tool covers commercial real estate within EU countries. As a first phase of integration, GRESB has automated the process of filling in the CRREM Tool with the asset-level performance data uploaded to the GRESB Asset Portal. This means that GRESB Participants can already begin to leverage their asset-level reporting to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets against the CRREM pathways. Later phases will have a broader scope, to include the new global pathways, and a full integration into the Asset Portal.To see the risk exposures for your assets, upload your asset-level data into the Asset Portal and click on “CRREM Tool”. Resilient Real Assets: Update from the 2019 Resilience Module We are also pleased to release Resilient Real Assets: Update from the 2019 Resilience Module. The report has insights about the state of the industry and practice from last year’s Resilience Module. It also provides updates and recommendations based on the 316 companies and funds that completed the Module.The lessons learned have informed the development of the 2020 Resilience Module. The Module now has a closer alignment with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and provides more emphasis on the identification, assessment, and management of material risks and greater detail about the use of forward-looking scenarios The 2020 Resilience Module remains an optional supplement to the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. We encourage you to complete the Module and get prepared for the questions that will be coming your way from investors and regulators.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/decarbonization-pathways-for-real-estate-available-for-public-consultation/,Decarbonization Pathways for Real Estate Available for Public Consultation,"Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) announces the public release of decarbonization pathways for the global real estate sector and the finalization of the tool to identify and manage transition risks for individual assets. The pathways will help market participants meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The downscaling pathways published today on the CRREM website identify annual energy- and carbon-intensity trajectories until 2050 across real estate markets and sectors that are consistent with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. This is a policy goal endorsed by most municipal and national governments and thereby constitutes a plausible scenario against which future climate-related transition risk can be assessed. The major investors supporting CRREM aim to establish it as a global standard for developing long-term decarbonization pathways in the real estate sector based on a transparent and scientifically rigorous methodology. CRREM covers 28 countries in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific across the commercial real estate sector, including retail, offices, and logistics, as well as the residential sector. GRESB, the ESG benchmark for real assets, is integrating the decarbonization pathways into its range of information resources covering ESG risks in real estate markets, and the European Commission’s high-level expert group referenced CRREM in its final report on the upcoming EU Taxonomy on sustainable finance in March. Real estate plays a major role in combatting climate change. The construction and operation of buildings accounts for 39 percent of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions globally, and much higher percentages in densely populated urban centers. This exposes the real estate sector to significant climate-related transition risk as governments have started to impose increasingly stringent regulations on energy use and emissions from buildings to meet their own climate goals. Regulatory risk around energy and carbon is shaping market and technology trends in the real estate sector. As the temperature is projected to rise 3.8 degrees Celsius under current legislation, the decarbonization pathways aligned with 1.5- and 2-degree global carbon budgets reflect significant reduction requirements beyond current legislative requirements. CRREM estimates that the carbon-intensity of the building sector will globally have to decline from currently approx. 52 kgCO2e/m²/pa to below 10 kgCO2e/m²/pa by 2050 in order to be in line with the 2-degree global carbon budget. Such a scenario would have significant implications for long-term asset planning and risk management in the sector – especially for developed countries which in some cases are facing 100 kgCO2e/m²/pa as a starting point for office buildings (based on a whole-building approach). Calculation of the global reduction targets and the derived national targets for different asset classes in the real estate sector create added-value for investors. Added value, for example, includes the transparent analysis of carbon risks, calculation of the abatement costs and analyzing the correct timing of retrofit measures that are needed to minimize climate-related transition risk. Besides the pathways, CRREM also finalized the development of a tool to manage stranding risk for individual buildings. All information required is aligned with the information GRESB collects at the asset level in order to assess and benchmark the performance of real asset portfolios. The software is Excel-based and has undergone a significant testing phase. It is available on the crrem.eu website. The decarbonization pathways were developed by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with technical support from GRESB. They were developed with the oversight of the newly instituted CRREM Scientific Advisory Committee, comprised of carefully selected academic experts with backgrounds in real estate and environmental sustainability across European, North American, and Asian markets. The initiative was funded by APG, PGGM and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) and received further support from Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund and Ivanhoé Cambridge. It builds on an initial project focusing on the commercial real estate sector in the European Union, which was funded by the European Commission. The Scientific Advisory Committee is comprised of the following members: Dr. Georgia Warren-Myers who is Senior Lecturer in Property at the Melbourne School of Design, Prof. Andy van den Dobbelsteen (PhD MSc) who is Professor of Climate Design & Sustainability at the Delft University of Technology and Dr. Paul Mathew who is a Staff Scientist and Department Head of Whole Building System at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Invitation to provide written feedback CRREM calls on all relevant market participants, including investors, managers, real estate investment trusts (REITs), green rating systems and other stakeholders, to share their views on the methodology of the decarbonization pathways and their usefulness in understanding and managing long-term climate-related transition risk in the global real estate sector. We ask that written responses are submitted to [email protected] by June 15th 2020. A summary of consultation responses will be publicly released following the end of the public consultation period.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/real-estate-industry-and-the-covid-19-crisis/,Real estate industry and the Covid-19 crisis,"May 2020 – The Covid-19 pandemic is a human tragedy that is unprecedented in modern times. Beyond claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the world, it has severely disrupted the daily lives of citizens and the functioning of the economy in Europe and across the globe. All countries and economic sectors have been affected. While protecting health and security is paramount, it is also essential to keep vitally important economic sectors functioning during the crisis, making it easier to restart the economy as people are able to return to work. The commercial real estate sector in Europe is a major contributor to these efforts. As a partner to municipalities, local and national governments all across the continent, we have done our utmost to support our communities, tenants, public authorities and health services during the Covid-19 crisis and we stand ready to live up to our significant social and economic responsibility as society re-opens. Real estate, which generally describes the built environment in which we all live and work, plays a vital role in every aspect of the economy, society and environment. Businesses and society are critically dependent on the availability of offices, shops, factories, housing, logistics facilities and many other forms of real estate. The commercial real estate sector delivers and manages the infrastructure needed for entrepreneurship to thrive and places to work. It is, therefore, a fundamental source of employment and economic growth, and a major contributor in addressing two critical challenges of our time: providing liveable and functioning cities for a growing urban population, including offering work and office space for businesses of all sizes, and reducing the environmental footprint of the built environment. Aside from transforming the physical environment in which we lead our daily lives, the real estate sector also directly benefits European citizens, serving as an important catalyst for job creation and feeding so many distinct parts of the economy. The most recent available figures show the commercial real estate industry directly employs 4.0 million people and contributes EUR 385 billion to the European economy annually. Annual investment in new commercial buildings and the refurbishment and development of existing buildings in Europe typically averages around EUR 250-300 billion and represents 10% of total investment in the economy. Investment in housing, other buildings and infrastructure is also substantial, and together with commercial real estate, totals approximately EUR 1.3 trillion annually, which is almost two-thirds of capital investment in the European economy. The capital and expertise that real estate firms can deploy are especially important when society is undergoing rapid change and buildings need to change to remain fit for purpose. The challenges following the pandemic will undoubtedly accelerate the need for such investment over the coming years. Real estate involves the construction, refurbishment and, importantly as technology and society change, repurposing of buildings for different uses. The upkeep, management and care of buildings is also a critical function, undertaken to ensure that buildings are safe and fit for purpose. It is carried out either directly by property owners or on their behalf by a growing number of specialist contractors, many of which are SMEs. These activities are an essential part of maintaining and improving the quality of the accommodation provided to businesses and have not been put on hold during the current crisis even though some tenants are not able to keep up with their lease obligations. Real estate investment also enables the provision of suitable office space, which is especially important for businesses. When new and growing businesses can rent space rather than buy, they gain flexibility and agility in location and employment dynamics required to maximize new opportunities. Renting also frees up available capital, increasing SME’s potential to invest in business expansion and R&D, thereby supporting the European economy, which is a particularly important point as we recover from the current crisis. The effective operation of a rental market for workspace matters enormously in times of flux and heightened uncertainty. Real estate also plays a key role when technological and cultural developments affect the way that our society works. Over the last decade, as shopping has increasingly moved online and away from high streets and shopping centers, owners of commercial real estate have developed the large warehouses that are replacing shops, and started the huge task of repurposing parts of the high street. The Covid- 19 crisis has accelerated these profound changes in the high street, the center of our towns, and the commercial real estate industry will play an important part in post-crisis recovery and town center regeneration, so important to societal morale. Real estate is a long-term business that is capital intensive. Much of that capital investment comes from insurers and pension funds that use it to match their long-term liabilities to provide reliable income and dividends, contributing to the retirement of millions of pensioners and policyholders, while making a major contribution to the development and renewal of the built environment. Private investors also save for their retirement by investing directly in real estate through retail funds or by investing in listed property companies. Another significant part of the capital takes the form of debt provided by Europe’s banks and other lenders, reducing the overall cost of real estate and making the allocation of risk and returns more efficient. Refurbishment and re-development of existing buildings, along with the construction of new buildings, also enable our industry to make an important contribution to the sustainability agenda and energy efficiency, supporting Europe’s green goals. In many cases, this can be done in conjunction with the repurposing of buildings as society’s needs and preferences change, as they no doubt will after the pandemic emergency, and as technology evolves. The European real estate investment industry fully supports and appreciates the measures taken thus far by national governments and the European institutions to soften the financial impact of the crisis on the economy in Europe. Our industry is committed to work with policymakers to explore ways that we can most effectively contribute to support businesses, employees and customers as we take steps together to emerge from the crisis and re-start the economy in Europe. We also believe real estate owners should work together with those who use the space they provide, their lenders and investors, and the many specialist firms that supply them with services, labor and materials to ensure that the costs of this crisis do not fall too heavily on any one set of economic actors. National governments and the European institutions are already working to develop measures designed to support economic stability and recovery. The real estate investment industry would like to recommend five key principles that we believe policymakers should keep in mind to develop measures that will successfully achieve our common goals. Measures should recognize that the real estate that makes up the heart of our towns and cities is inextricably interconnected through its owners to insurance companies, pension funds and the banking system and therefore, ultimately, investments of the greater public and they should support the integrity of that interconnectedness; Measures should create incentives for landlords, lenders, investors and tenants to work together so none is forced to bear the full impact of the current crisis and so all will be in a position to contribute to both economic recovery and European financial and social stability more generally; Measures should be time-limited although recognizing that many businesses will likely take some time to recover; Measures should be implemented quickly, particularly those targeting businesses that have little financial resilience and mounting liabilities; and New measures should complement the measures policymakers have already introduced to support businesses and could be strengthened through improved cross-border investment possibilities in real estate stabilizing national economies across Europe and to facilitate a resilient and sustainable economic recovery."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/worldgbc-and-gresb-join-forces-to-drive-net-zero-carbon-buildings/,WorldGBC and GRESB join forces to drive  net zero carbon buildings,"World Green Building Council, a global network of around 70 Green Building Councils, has announced a collaboration with GRESB, the leading global sustainability benchmark for real estate portfolios, to recognize companies that make a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. 30 April – London, England: World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) and GRESB have announced a collaboration that will see companies who commit to making their portfolios ‘Paris Proof’ by signing WorldGBC’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment (the Commitment) recognized. The Commitment, which recognizes businesses committed to ensuring their portfolio of buildings operate at net zero carbon by 2030, and advocate for all buildings to be net zero carbon by 2050, is supported by Green Building Councils’ asset level net zero standards in 15 countries and counting, which all adhere to WorldGBC’s global principles for net zero carbon buildings and provide third party assurance of performance. The inclusion of the Commitment by GRESB is hoped to drive uptake of net zero standards across large portfolios in addition to dozens of other Green Building Council rating tools already recognized. Globally, almost 40% of energy-related greenhouse emissions occur from buildings, with 28% coming from the operations of buildings themselves. The Commitment is unique in positioning energy efficiency as a central component to achieving decarbonization across building portfolios, in addition to generating and procuring renewable energy to meet reduced energy demand. This represents the most cost-effective, best practice approach to ensuring buildings are fit for purpose and provide healthy and comfortable environments. At the beginning of this crucial decade of delivery for collective climate action, this collaboration will serve to create investor certainty through: the framework of the Commitment, the annual benchmarking process of GRESB, the value of asset and portfolio decarbonization strategies, and the futureproofing for a net zero economy. Under the new partnership, the two organisations will: explore how the requirements of the Commitment can be addressed through the GRESB Real Estate Assessmentcollaborate on opportunities to share data and knowledge to champion the leadership and ambition being shown by common membersjointly promote and advocate real estate companies to transition their assets and portfolio towards a decarbonized built environmentdevelop a pathway for Green Building Councils’ net zero rating tools and standards to be recognized in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment The GRESB Real Estate Assessment also recognizes where organizations are committed to other environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting protocols, including Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI), Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the UN Global Goals for Sustainable Development. Greater alignment between WorldGBC and GRESB in recognizing responsible market practices from leading organizations is crucial to drive these best practices throughout the wider industry. Local Green Building Councils that form the WorldGBC network facilitate this market transformation through advocacy work with their members and local governments; and by building industry capacity. Cristina Gamboa, CEO, World Green Building Council said: “The Commitment provides a framework for real estate organizations to take action towards net zero carbon portfolios, and new recognition within GRESB Assessments will champion these actions and provide investor confidence in target setting. The next decade is crucial to realize the ambition of the Paris Agreement so now is the time to be seen to act.” Cristina Gamboa, CEO, World Green Building Council said: “The Commitment provides a framework for real estate organizations to take action towards net zero carbon portfolios, and new recognition within GRESB Assessments will champion these actions and provide investor confidence in target setting. The next decade is crucial to realize the ambition of the Paris Agreement so now is the time to be seen to act.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate, GRESB said: “We are excited by this opportunity to work hand in hand with the World Green Building Council to provide greater alignment between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This will in turn support the collective industry effort to transition to net zero emissions and advance sustainable real estate.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate, GRESB said: “We are excited by this opportunity to work hand in hand with the World Green Building Council to provide greater alignment between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment. This will in turn support the collective industry effort to transition to net zero emissions and advance sustainable real estate.” Sara Neff, Senior Vice President, Sustainability, Kilroy Realty, a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment signatory and GRESB’s 5 year running North American Leader in Sustainability said: “The collaboration between GRESB and WorldGBC will rapidly increase awareness of the importance of climate change commitments, which would both spur adoption of the NZCB Commitment and GBC tools, and accelerate climate action among GRESB respondents.” Sara Neff, Senior Vice President, Sustainability, Kilroy Realty, a Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment signatory and GRESB’s 5 year running North American Leader in Sustainability said: “The collaboration between GRESB and WorldGBC will rapidly increase awareness of the importance of climate change commitments, which would both spur adoption of the NZCB Commitment and GBC tools, and accelerate climate action among GRESB respondents.” The full list of the Commitment signatories comprises 48 businesses and organizations including major private sector leaders acknowledging the key role that they must play to tackle the climate crisis. Additionally, governments with 28 cities including London, New York and Tokyo, and six states and regions including California and Scotland have made the Commitment towards net zero carbon buildings by 2050. The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment has the power to radically reduce the building sector’s environmental impact by spearheading a global shift towards aggressive energy efficiency as well as a complete change from fossil fuel-based energy to renewables. Matthew Black, World Green Building Council [email protected] +44 (0) 7415 057 193 Rebecca Moir, World Green Building Council [email protected] Claudia Gonella, GRESB[email protected] The Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment comes from Advancing Net Zero, WorldGBC’s global project to accelerate uptake of net zero carbon buildings to 100% by 2050. The project works with the global Green Building Council network to develop tools and resources, including net zero carbon building certification schemes and training programs. The Commitment was launched in September 2018 at the Global Climate Action Summit. It promotes and inspires leadership action on an advanced trajectory from business, governments and NGOs, to scale up responses to net zero carbon buildings through corporate and policy action. See the full profiles of company signatories and what they are committing to here: https://www.worldgbc.org/commitment-signatories A list of all green building certification schemes recognized by GRESB is found in Appendix 5a of the 2020 GRESB Real Estate Assessment Reference Guide. The World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) is a global network leading the transformation of the built environment, to make it healthier and sustainable. Collectively, with our Green Building Councils (GBCs) in around 70 countries, we accelerate action to deliver on the ambition of the Paris Agreement, by eliminating the buildings and construction sector’s emissions by 2050. We are committed to green buildings for everyone, everywhere to build a better future. Through its global Advancing Net Zero project, WorldGBC is working to help shape a future in which every building in the world is entirely net zero carbon by 2050, eliminating the building and construction sector’s reliance on fossil fuels which are causing irreversible damage to the planet. In order to achieve this goal, the buildings and construction industry must take urgent action to prevent the emissions associated with materials and construction processes throughout the building lifecycle. Snapshots detail how Green Building Council tools and programs, including net zero carbon building certification schemes, are building industry capacity to deliver high-performance buildings that demonstrate the sector’s potential for decarbonization. www.worldgbc.org Mission-driven and investor-led, GRESB is the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets.

It’s also relevant for existing participants and GRESB Partners who would like a refresher on the reporting process. The in-person training will take place in select cities around the world in March and April. This year, the real estate in-person training will take the form of a hands-on workshop focussed on advanced reporting concepts and the Performance Component. The in-person Infrastructure training sessions will cover the same information as the online course. We hope to see you there. And in the meantime, please contact us if you have any comments or queries.

Each year real estate and infrastructure managers use the Assessments to measure, benchmark and improve their sustainability programs and report to their investors on their ESG performance. The attention from investors on ESG performance has never been higher. At last count, more than institutional and financial investors, representing over USD 22 trillion, use GRESB ESG data and tools in their investment decision-making. The 2020 Assessments have been shaped by an extensive engagement with our stakeholders, industry working groups and governance bodies. The changes reflect the evolution of the investment industry as measured by the benchmark, support our efforts to improve data quality and establish the building blocks for improved measurement of real-world performance and impacts over the next few years. Review the 2020 GRESB Assessments The Pre-release materials are available on the Participant Guidance page, together with a step-by-step guide to successfully completing the Assessments when the portal opens on April 1, 2020.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/2020-gresb-infrastructure-assessments-development/,2020 GRESB Infrastructure Assessments Development,"GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real assets, providing standardized and validated data to capital markets. We were established in 2009 by a group of large pension funds who wanted to have access to reliable data on the ESG performance of their real estate investments. In 2015, a group of ten founding infrastructure investors came together to establish the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments. In the intervening years, GRESB has grown to become the leading Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) benchmark for real estate and infrastructure investments across the world. Our efforts over the last 10 years have focussed on collaborating with the industry to define a common approach to ESG measurement and reporting and building a high-quality data ecosystem to support it. Read our “10 years of GRESB” report for more details. This heritage, plus four years of reporting on GRESB infrastructure, provides a strong foundation for the future. We are now entering a new phase of work where we will place more focus on performance data quality and scoring in the Assessments and benchmarks. The restructuring of our 2020 Assessments into separate Management and Performance Components is an important step in enabling us to support this new phase of work. [wpupg-grid-with-filters id=”2020-infra-pre-release”] Development Process The annual Assessment development process is informed by in-house data analysis, market research, detailed gap analysis/alignment work, feedback from Assessment users and strong participation from our governance groups (described conceptually in the figure below). This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. April – November 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved: Mapping ESG topics and metrics covered by other reporting standards and frameworks relevant to our stakeholders;Identifying areas of potential alignment between those topics and our Assessment; Reviewing and analysing the current responses to all indicators; Reviewing which indicators and metrics were of limited analytical value or of limited interest to investors, and evaluating whether these would be kept or amended. November 2019 – January 2020: Engagement with our governance groups, the Infrastructure Advisory Board and the Infrastructure Benchmark Committee, to discuss the proposed changes and to generate further input into the Assessments. January 2020: Incorporating final comments and publishing the pre-release of the 2020 Fund and Asset Assessments. Mindful of how the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments have developed over the last four years, changes this year are incremental, and focused on ensuring that the Assessments are fit for purpose and ready to support a greater focus on performance over the next few years. The Fund Assessment has been further aligned to the Asset and Real Estate Assessments. Similar to the Real Estate Assessment, the Asset Assessment has been split into distinct Management and Performance Components. The Management Component has been streamlined with some indicators merged or removed. In addition, the integrated materiality assessment has been refined. The Fund Assessment now consists of a Management Component only, with the scores of the fund’s underlying assets informing the fund’s performance score. The Asset Assessment consists of both a Management and Performance Component. Assets can complete either Component, but will only obtain a GRESB Score if they submit both Components. Overall, the 2020 Assessments provide more consistency between Infrastructure and Real Estate and an improved alignment with other relevant standards and frameworks. The Assessments also lay the groundwork for us to provide new data and analytical tools in the GRESB portal and support a further evolution in data quality. Infrastructure Fund Structural changes The Fund Assessment has been reviewed and further aligned with the Asset Assessment and the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The Fund Assessment will consist of a Management Component, called the Management Component – Infrastructure Fund, which is aligned with the Management Component in the Asset Assessment. The Performance Component of the Fund Assessment will simply comprise the Asset Assessments for the underlying assets. The new Management Component – Infrastructure Fund has been split into five aspects: LeadershipPoliciesReportingRisk ManagementStakeholder Engagement Changes relating to content New indicators have been added in employee engagement, reflecting the importance of these stakeholders to the ESG performance of funds. The new indicators will not be scored in 2020. The indicator on ESG monitoring has been removed since this monitoring is better reflected in the assessments of the underlying assets. For the same alignment reasons, several metrics have been added, changed or removed. Fund score names In order to clarify the use of the various Fund scores, their names have been revised. Funds completing the Management Component will obtain a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Fund. If more than 25% of their underlying assets complete both the Asset Management and Performance Components, the average aggregated GRESB Scores for those assets will provide the Performance Component Score for the Infrastructure Fund. Infrastructure Asset The Assessment has been split into Management and Performance Components, which in turn have been organized into new aspects to better represent the underlying indicators. The result is improved alignment with other reporting standards and frameworks and more consistency between the Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. The Management Component will focus on management and processes and be pitched at the organizational level. The Performance Component will focus on measuring performance and be pitched at the asset level. The Management Component is suitable for any type of infrastructure company, asset and investment strategy. It is validated, scored and peer-benchmarked using the globally recognized GRESB methodology, and can be completed individually or in combination with the Performance Component. Each Component determines an individual score, but only entities that submit both Components will receive a GRESB Score and GRESB Rating. Materiality approach refined The integrated materiality assessment is a fundamental element of the Asset Assessment and tailors each Assessment to the particular characteristics of the participating asset. A thorough review of the materiality approach resulted in new ESG issues, materiality factors and sectors being added, and weightings being refined for certain ESG issues. Importantly, the materiality threshold has been lifted from ‘No relevanceʼ to ‘Low relevanceʼ so that issues deemed of ‘No relevanceʼ or ‘Low relevanceʼ will no longer be scored (previously ‘Low relevance issues were scored). This reduces the number of indicators that need to be addressed by participants and lowers the reporting burden. Reporting boundaries The description of reporting boundaries has been clarified by providing checklists of ancillary activities, allowing for exceptions for particular indicators to be more easily reported. These descriptions are essential to allow reporting boundaries to be further standardized in the future, thereby facilitating benchmarks based on fair comparisons. Validation The validation process has been reviewed and improved in 2020. There will be a heavier focus on automatic validation of all indicators using rules and (for the first time in the Infrastructure Assessment) outlier checks. Manual validation will focus on the most relevant indicators and remove the need for evidence upload for less important indicators. The indicators and evidence that will be manually validated will be defined and consistently applied from year to year. Asset score names Assets completing the Management Component – Infrastructure Asset will receive a Management Component Score – Infrastructure Asset. They will only obtain an overall GRESB Score – Infrastructure Asset if they also complete the Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset. Scoring changes Participants will have the flexibility to complete either or both Management and Performance Components. New participants might start with the Management Component only, as a simple assessment with low reporting burden. This will assist with growing participation, for example in emerging markets. Some participants may only want to complete the Performance Component, to use the assessment for reporting their performance data only. Importantly, the premier measurement of ESG performance for investors will remain the full GRESB Assessment (i.e. Management plus Performance Components). This will be emphasized in our communications to prevent any intentional or accidental greenwashing. In the GRESB Model, the Management Component score will replace the Management & Policy (MP) score and the Performance Component score will replace the Implementation & Measurement (IM) score. The Management Component – Infrastructure Asset has been restructured into five aspects. The new aspects align with the Real Estate Assessment and external sustainability frameworks where practical. The new aspects have been mapped to the 2019 indicators and aspects, enabling comparisons over time; LeadershipPoliciesReportingRisk ManagementStakeholder Engagement Changes relating to content Several indicators were amended, from slight name changes, added or removed metrics, to changes to the structure of indicators. The Performance Component – Infrastructure Asset comprises the 2019 aspects on Performance Indicators and Certifications & Awards, as well as the 2019 indicators on employee training (formerly MA7) and implementation of actions (formerly RO4). The Component has been restructured in alignment with the 2020 Real Estate Assessment into twelve aspects: ImplementationOutput & ImpactHealth & SafetyEnergyGreenhouse Gas EmissionsAir PollutionWaterWasteBiodiversity & HabitatEmployeesCustomersCertifications & Awards Materiality approach refined With the lifting of the materiality threshold, the number of indicators that need to be addressed in the Performance Component will be reduced for most participants. This should mean a significant reduction in reporting burden. Indicators that are not material may still be reported on, on a purely optional basis. Reporting on implementation of actions (formerly RO4) has been split into separate Environmental, Social and Governance indicators for more structured communication of the implementation of measures and actions. The indicators on customer and employee satisfaction programs (formerly PI9.1 and PI10.1) have been removed since these actions can be reported under implementation. All metrics have been reviewed against external standards and frameworks such as CDP, DJSI and GRI. As a result, several metrics have been renamed, modified or removed for better alignment. Questions have been added on the external review of quantitative data to enable us to further improve data quality. The new questions will be unscored. Assessment Pre-Release The Assessment Pre-Release is now available: 2020 Infrastructure Fund Assessment Pre-Release2020 Infrastructure Asset Assessment Pre-Release While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2020 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2020 Infrastructure Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications. The Resilience Module will run for the third year and will continue being offered as an optional supplement to both the Infrastructure Fund and Asset Assessments. The Module is scored separately and does not influence other scores. The road ahead Looking ahead, we will continue to work with our governance groups and industry stakeholders to further develop the Assessments, benchmark methodology and the resulting analytics. Changing emphasis from Management to Performance Over the coming years, the emphasis of the Assessments will shift to having a greater focus on performance. This will be achieved through four main mechanisms: These changes will take place progressively and be clearly flagged in advance to give time for the industry to understand and adjust to expectations. Simultaneously, we will use the performance metrics to enable reporting of impacts in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Reducing reporting burden We will continue to make further improvements to reduce the reporting burden, including: Continuing to improve alignment with the most relevant industry reporting frameworks such as PRI, CDP, DJSI (RobecoSAM), GRI, SASB and IFC. GRESB has built relationships with these organizations and will continue to explore opportunities for further streamlining of our assessments.Automating data transfer from the participant side through greater use of spreadsheets and data APIs. Whilst this requires some investment from GRESB, data partners and participants in the short term, it will ultimately streamline the processing of data and reporting inputs, requiring far less human intervention and ultimately reducing both resource requirements and the risk of errors. Increasing transparency Transparency is one of GRESB’s core values. We have had considerable feedback on the need for greater transparency of our own practices and we have responded by publishing our entire Assessment methodology and scoring documentation. We will continue to provide even greater transparency to assist participants to better understand our requirements and processes and thereby enable them to report more accurately and get more direct and immediate feedback on their ESG performance. Changes will include: Providing the scoring details upfront with the Assessment Reference Guides and in the Portal.In the longer term, providing draft scoring within the Portal so that participants can see their draft (unvalidated) score ‘as they go’, thus providing immediate feedback and enabling them to ask ‘what-if’ questions.Providing details of the validation decisions in the benchmark report including what was validated at what level and why.Providing immediate feedback on calculated variables derived from assessment inputs such as intensity metrics. In this way, participants will be immediately aware of their performance and can use this to start thinking about how to improve their performance immediately, rather than waiting until the results are released. This also provides a check for them on their inputs, since these calculated variables should be more comparable to their peers than their raw absolute metric inputs. More flexible outputs Consistent with developments in the world of ‘big data’, GRESB investor members are seeking to use their data in more varied and flexible ways. We will provide both tailored solutions around specific products and greater flexibility for advanced users in the future. These outputs will be developed through close engagement with investors to include: Customized impact analyses and peer group comparisonsEnhanced portfolio analysis including footprinting based on aggregated asset dataTailored reports on portfolios aligned with key reporting frameworks More insight on participant performance To provide more insights on participant performance GRESB will: Standardize the metrics to ensure that all participants within each sector are reporting comparable data. This includes developing standards for boundaries and assumptions and ensuring that data is accurate at asset level.Improve data cleaning mechanisms such as outlier checks and pre-validation to minimize participant entry errors.Add new indicators where needed to address emerging material issues, such as:Carbon footprinting and net zero carbonData availability and qualitySocial impactSocial licence (using external, rather than self-reported data)Supply chain (including Modern Slavery)Digitalization For more information about the future development of the GRESB Infrastructure Assessments and our priorities to achieve our shared vision of sustainable real assets, click here."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/asset-level-reporting-fundamental-for-evaluating-real-estate-performance/,Asset-level reporting: fundamental for evaluating Real Estate Performance,"Since its establishment 10 years ago, GRESB has been at the heart of a collaborative effort to build consensus on what constitutes ESG materiality in the real estate sector, define standardized metrics, and develop a consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance. It’s a communal effort and we are grateful to be supported by a powerful global ecosystem of investors, lenders, managers, service providers and industry bodies working to improve ESG transparency across the world. We are now entering a new phase of industry development where greater ESG transparency must be a means to improve the ESG performance of the underlying assets in real estate portfolios. Where real progress towards improving operational performance is the priority, not transparency for its own sake. This shift comes in response to changing demand from the investor community, who increasingly expect managers to be able to monitor their assets directly, on the basis of real, reliable ESG performance data. This higher-resolution data will enable us to provide more granular and reliable ESG data and benchmarks, unlock a new generation of performance insights from asset-level up, and support a systematic tracking of industry progress against sector-specific targets, as well as local and global goals. Asset-level reporting will facilitate the next evolution in data accessibility and reliability in the GRESB Assessments and Benchmarks. We are introducing a new asset-level validation process and implementing more automated error and outlier checks. The algorithms are iterative and will “learn” from the feedback provided by our participants on an on-going basis. The result will provide access to consolidated ESG performance at the portfolio level that is underscored by improved data quality at the asset level. More data does not have to mean a higher reporting burden. We host an increasing number of API connections with GRESB Data Partners and are continuously investing in state-of-the-art tools to facilitate new levels of data sharing and a more seamless reporting experience. With ESG data becoming increasingly relevant in investment decision making, index products, loans, bonds and commercial agreements, it is our responsibility to ensure a fair and robust benchmarking process, eliminating blind spots and creating comparable performance baselines that the industry can rely on. As the reported data becomes more granular, we gain exponential visibility into how the assets operate and can provide a more rigorous analysis of ESG performance. Having asset-level data as the baseline for analysis will open up a deeper understanding of exposure to environmental risks and help to uncover the sources of improvements in a portfolio as well as the links to future portfolio performance. It will also enable consistent calculations of intensities and performance against targets, without the issue of embedded methodological differences. In addition, overlaying fundamentals, such as building location and age, will enable a deeper and more sophisticated analysis of portfolio resilience and performance. As part of this work, we are upgrading the Asset Portal to enable managers to assess the exposure of their assets to specific ESG risks. These new services are based on integrating geo-coded asset data with third-party geospatial risk datasets and will be accessible entirely at the discretion of managers. Our 2019 collaboration with Verisk Maplecroft on the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard, which focuses on physical climate risk data, is an early example of this approach. Going forward, these integrations will be available directly in the Portal, and will expand to include financial and other third-party datasets. Asset-level data can be aggregated to the city, country, region and global level, enabling a bottom-up, systematic understanding of what needs to be done to address the sustainability challenge. It enables an analysis of the bigger picture, the aggregate story, about how well the industry is progressing against key goals and global targets such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, World Green Building Council (WorldGBC) Net Zero targets, as well as other more local targets and sector-specific goals. The 2020 GRESB Real Estate Assessment will include an integration with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology to show real estate carbon transition pathways at both asset and portfolio level to remain within 1.5 and 2.0 degrees of warming. These pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the retrofit investments required to transition to a low carbon economy. For further information, see the Pre-release of the 2020 Real Estate Assessment and the 2020 Real Estate Assessment development process."

This approach ensures that our Assessments and benchmarks are shaped and driven by the stakeholders we serve and helps move the entire industry closer to our shared vision of sustainable real assets. 2020 Assessments Structure An important outcome of the 2020 Assessment development process has been a reconfirmation that the Assessments address material ESG topics for the real estate and infrastructure industry. As a result, the 2020 development process was limited to making structural changes to the Assessments rather than introducing new indicators or making extensive content changes with an impact on scoring. The structural changes arise from the introduction of the separate Management, Performance and Development Components. On the content side, the number of indicators in the Assessments has been reduced and several indicators have been simplified. This is particularly apparent in the Performance Component, where the introduction of asset-level reporting has allowed the removal of several indicators measuring data availability and coverage. With the introduction of the GRESB Development Benchmark, participants with development activities will have a better understanding of their ESG performance and how this compares to their peers. Previously, this benchmark only included developers, but now managers with both standing investments and development projects will be included in both the GRESB Developer Benchmark and GRESB Real Estate Benchmark and will receive two Benchmark Reports to reflect their performance in each category. Overall, the 2020 Assessments provide more consistency between real estate and infrastructure and an improved alignment with other responding standards and frameworks. The Assessments also lay the groundwork for us to provide new data and analytical tools in the Portal and support a further evolution in data quality. The starting point for the Assessment development process was the 2019 Assessments. The 2019 indicators have been allocated to the new Management, Performance and Development components, on the basis that: The Management Component measures the entity’s strategy and leadership management, policies and processes, risk management and stakeholder engagement approaches, comprising of information collected at the organizational level. The Performance Component measures the entity’s asset portfolio performance, comprising of information collected at the asset and at the portfolio level. It is suitable for any real estate company or fund with operational assets. The Development Component measures the entity’s efforts to address ESG issues during the design, construction, and renovation of buildings. This component is suitable for entities involved innew construction (building design, site selection and/or construction) and/or major renovation projects, with on-going projects or completed projects during the reporting period. Management Component Development process: April – September 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments. This involved mapping ESG topics covered by other frameworks relevant to our stakeholders and identifying areas of potential alignment and improvement in our Assessments. This allows us to work towards market convergence on the main ESG topics, increase reporting efficiencies and ensure our Assessments continue to reflect the most commonly used indicators and metrics. Based on this exercise, we extended the scope of our indicators to capture data and information that was not previously tracked. We performed a detailed alignment exercise between the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure AssessmentsWe identified indicators and sections that could/should be removed because:They have little or no analytical valueThey have reached a maturity level that makes them redundant for an ESG benchmarkWe aligned the aspects for Real Estate and Infrastructure and connected them better with the new set of indicators They have little or no analytical valueThey have reached a maturity level that makes them redundant for an ESG benchmark Key outcomes: Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees, the Management Component does not introduce new topics or scored indicators. The developments are largely structural and are limited to: Restructuring into five aspects: Leadership, Policies, Reporting, Risk management, Stakeholder engagement New answer options to strengthen alignment across all AssessmentsNew answer options to strengthen alignment with other external frameworks (e.g. PRI, RobecoSAM, CDP, etc.)All indicators are formulated at the entity level (i.e. “Does the entity…..”?)Each indicator is assigned a title, to facilitate easy referencing in various documents and data download tools Performance Component Development process: April – December 2019: Internal review and gap analysis between the most important industry standards and the Assessments with a few primary changes in mind: Adapting all Performance Indicators and Building Certifications indicators for required asset level reportingImproving data quality of the reported data by increasing the simplicity of the reporting structure and improving data granularity to enable better data checks by the GRESB Portal, participant users, and validatorsImproving data standardization by ensuring that data can be reported using the same format for multiple years, facilitating easier data exchange between systems. Additionally, enhanced energy data granularity enables the calculation of comparable GHG data Key outcomes: Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees and Advisory Board, the Performance Component includes a combination of portfolio-level and asset-level indicators. The scope of the Component is reduced and enables performance measurement at the asset level: No new indicators were introducedRestructured into 10 aspects:Portfolio-level aspects: Risks Assessment, Data Review, Targets, Tenants and CommunityAsset-level aspects: Energy, GHG Emissions, Water, Waste, Efficiency Measures, Building CertificationsMandatory asset level reporting for all aspects/indicators marked “Asset level”The concept of ”managed/indirectly managed assets” replaced by a distinction between landlord controlled and tenant controlled areas, in line with other industry frameworksReduced complexity and reporting burden through the removal of several indicators:ME2: Data management systemsME3, ME 4, ME 5: Energy consumption, Water consumption, Waste management monitoring methodsPI1.2, PI2.2, PI3.2: Energy, GHG emissions, Water use intensity ratesRO4, RO5, RO6, RO7: Technical building assessments and implementation of energy, water, waste efficiency measures are simplified and measured at asset levelGRESB will introduce new Energy and Water use intensity calculations, using information reported at the asset level. The methodology will evolve over time, in collaboration with our governance groups and will not be used for scoring in 2020.Standardized reporting of Scope 2 GHG emissions data using a location-based approach. In addition, participants can also report the market-based calculated values on a voluntary basis. Portfolio-level aspects: Risks Assessment, Data Review, Targets, Tenants and CommunityAsset-level aspects: Energy, GHG Emissions, Water, Waste, Efficiency Measures, Building Certifications ME2: Data management systemsME3, ME 4, ME 5: Energy consumption, Water consumption, Waste management monitoring methodsPI1.2, PI2.2, PI3.2: Energy, GHG emissions, Water use intensity ratesRO4, RO5, RO6, RO7: Technical building assessments and implementation of energy, water, waste efficiency measures are simplified and measured at asset level Development Component Development process: November 2018 – November 2019: The Assessment development process began at the end of 2018, with a survey of all 300+ GRESB participants with new construction and major renovations activities (either as part of pure developer portfolios, or as part of mixed portfolios with both standing investments and development projects). We received 91 responses, representing approx. 150 entities. Key feedback from the survey included: Participating entities need separate scores for standing investment and development projectsInvolvement in NC&MR should not impact peer group allocationNC&MR share similar material ESG issues and should continue being analysed together. Further segmentation would make results difficult to compareBuilding certifications is a critical topic for new developments We incorporated this feedback into our 2020 Assessment proposal in discussions with the Benchmark Committees. Key outcomes: The introduction of the GRESB Development Benchmark which will include both pure developers who previously completed the Developer Assessment, and managers who have both standing investments and development projects. Standing investments will be captured in the Performance Components and development projects in the Development Component With the combination of both the Management Component and Development Component, 400+ entities will now be able to understand and benchmark their ESG performance of development activities. In 2019, 41 entities participated in the Developer Assessment and these entities made up the 2019 Developer Benchmark. 379 Real Estate entities also engaged in development activities in 2019, but their NC&MR aspect score was not included in the benchmarkPeer grouping will follow the Real Estate methodology, using property type of development projects, region and portfolio nature of ownership (i.e. listed, non-listed, etc.)Building certifications will continue to be an important aspect of the Development Component and subject-specific indicators are aligned with building certification best practices. Following engagement with the Benchmark Committees, the Development Component has seen largely a structural change with the introduction of aspects. These aspects include both policy/strategy indicators specifically relating to development activities, as well as the performance-related indicators: Restructured into seven aspects: ESG Requirements, Materials, Building Certifications, Energy, Water, Waste, and Stakeholder EngagementIntroduced new topics specific to development activities, through indicators on life-cycle assessments, disclosure of embodied carbon, and community engagement New answer options to strengthen alignment across all assessments and other external frameworks (e.g. PRI, RobecoSAM, CDP, etc.)New answer options based on commonly provided, accepted other answers The 2020 Management, Performance (including the Asset Level Spreadsheet) and Development components are available in pre-release versions here. While we do not anticipate making any material changes, we reserve the right to make modifications prior to the official start of the 2020 reporting period on April 1 and the official release of the 2020 Real Estate Assessment. We will publicly announce any such modifications. 2020 GRESB Results The GRESB Real Estate Benchmark will consist of participants completing both the Management and Performance Components. The GRESB Development Benchmark will consist of participants completing both the Management and Development Components. While each Component determines an individual score (ie: Management Component Score, Performance Component Score, Development Component Score), the GRESB Scores and GRESB Ratings will only apply to entities completing all relevant Components for their portfolios. The possible combinations are set out below and illustrated in the diagram that follows: A: Portfolios with only standing investments submit: Management and Performance Components to receive a GRESB Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Performance Component Score B: Portfolios with only development projects submit: Management and Development Components to receive a GRESB Development Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Development Component Score C: Portfolios with both standing investments and development projects submit: Management, Performance and Development Components to receive two Benchmark Reports:Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating; andDevelopment Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB RatingGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Performance Component ScoreGRESB Score = 30% * Management Component Score + 70% * Development Component Score Standing Investments Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating; andDevelopment Benchmark Report including a GRESB Score and a GRESB Rating The Resilience Module will run its third iteration and will continue being offered as an optional supplement to any Component of the Real Estate Assessment. The Module is scored separately and does not influence other scores. The Assessment reporting period remains the same as in previous years: 1 April – 1 July, 2020. Scoring implications The scoring implications of the restructured Assessment are set out below. The analysis uses the 2019 Real Estate Assessment results as baseline. 2020 The 2019 indicators have been allocated to the new Management, Performance and Development Components. As such, some indicators formerly classified under dimension IM (Implementation & Measurement) were moved to Management, while some others were either removed or no longer scored. The weights of the Assessment components (Management, Performance and Development) are set out below: Standing investments: GRESB Score = 30% Management Component Score + 70% Performance Component Score Development projects:GRESB Score = 30% Management Component Score + 70% Development Component Score The Management + Performance; Management + Development Components define the GRESB Standing Investments and Development models, respectively. The Component weights are fixed and apply to the Component scores expressed in percentages. The adjustment to a 30/70 split means that the 2020 GRESB Score will be weighted more towards Performance than in 2019. Additionally, as the weights determine the length of the axes in the GRESB model, there will be an impact on the quintile lines and the GRESB Rating in each benchmark. The results of this preliminary analysis against the 2019 baseline indicate that the impact on the GRESB Score is limited, but participants can expect an average decrease of a few points, in the Performance Score, assuming a “do nothing” scenario. This is consistent in both the Standing Investments and Development Benchmark. The evolution of scores is attributed to an increased weight to development activities and less weight on the policy/strategy of the Management Component. Overall, the evolution of scores is in line with our transition to a more performance-based Assessment that reflects the activity to improve the performance of the underlying assets in the portfolio. The road ahead Looking ahead, we will continue to work with our governance groups and industry stakeholders to further develop the Assessments, the benchmark methodology and the resulting analytics. Key priorities include: Developing models for normalizing energy and water use intensities at the asset-level accounting for material factors such as vacancy rate, degree/cooling days, property type, etc.Further refining our scoring model to start benchmarking asset-level intensities for all property-types (reflecting “true performance”) against comparable assets within their region.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/reflecting-on-the-last-10-years-of-gresb-and-preparing-for-whats-ahead/,Reflecting on the last 10 years of GRESB and preparing for what’s ahead,"Mainstreaming ESG benchmarking in real assets 10 years ago, APG, PGGM and USS came together with the University of Maastricht to design a real estate survey. They wanted more transparency on the ESG performance of their real estate investments and a closer engagement with their managers. The inaugural Real Estate Assessment was launched in 2009, and GRESB was born. In the years that followed, an entire industry has come together to develop a common language and consistent approach to measuring and reporting on ESG performance. Today, more than 100 investors, representing over USD 22 trillion AUM, encourage their managers to report to GRESB, and the resulting Real Estate and Infrastructure Benchmarks cover more than USD 4.5 trillion in real asset value. The reason why we established GRESB is simple. Ten years ago there was no uniform or consistent way to measure the sustainability performance of real estate companies and funds across countries, across regions and across private and publicly traded investment structures. And if you can’t measure and compare, it is difficult to engage with a manager on how to improve.” Patrick Kanters, Managing Director Global Real Assets at APG Asset Management The reason why we established GRESB is simple. Ten years ago there was no uniform or consistent way to measure the sustainability performance of real estate companies and funds across countries, across regions and across private and publicly traded investment structures. And if you can’t measure and compare, it is difficult to engage with a manager on how to improve.” This process of annual ESG benchmarking on such a large scale has built a powerful global ecosystem of investors, lenders, managers, service providers and industry bodies working towards a shared vision of sustainable real assets. It’s a story that demonstrates how a top-down demand for ESG transparency and benchmarking encourages a bottom-up response that drives the spread of sustainability best practices around the world, raising the standard of an entire industry. Standardized benchmarks work because they give clarity and direction to the market and a means to focus on complex problems. They help capital providers and asset managers compare investments across portfolios, inspiring a deeper engagement on the opportunities, risks and choices that need to be made as the industry transitions to a sustainable future. And at an aggregated level, benchmarks provide an objective reference point on sector and regional performance, help to track industry progress against relevant targets and shine a light on where to focus improvement efforts. Having the asset owner as the driving force behind the GRESB Assessments, and engaged in their development from the beginning, has been key to the rapid growth of the benchmark. This investor pressure is driving transformative change through the investment chain and raising the sustainability standard of an entire industry.” David Russell, Head of Responsible Investment at USS. Having the asset owner as the driving force behind the GRESB Assessments, and engaged in their development from the beginning, has been key to the rapid growth of the benchmark. This investor pressure is driving transformative change through the investment chain and raising the sustainability standard of an entire industry.” The report “10 years of GRESB” celebrates the key milestones in our development over the past decade and includes commentary from a group of sustainability champions from across the world who have inspired us with their leadership and commitment. Our industry is full of such people who have contributed so much to our collective vision and the growth of the benchmark. This momentum in the right direction is vital and should be celebrated, but it does not take away the urgency of the challenges that lie ahead. In the next decade we will need to take dramatic steps as an industry if we are to achieve sustainable real assets. Preeminent among the challenges is climate risk and resilience. Central banks have already made the link between climate risk and financial stability, calls for mandatory climate related disclosures are intensifying and it’s clear that the longer the industry delays in addressing risks associated with climate change the more disruptive the policy response will inevitably be. At the same time, it’s not enough to just focus on climate action. We are facing multiple convergent crises to which a sustainable real asset industry can make an important contribution – ecological system breakdown, mass extinctions, growing inequality, political instability, mass migrations, demographic changes and accelerated urbanization – and significant improvement in one area can only be delivered together with measures to increase progress in all areas. The stakes are getting higher for the industry and our success in the next decade will not only be measured by the coverage of our benchmarks, but by our ability to influence investment practices that lead to more sustainable and resilient real assets. We have listened to the feedback of our members, partners, governance bodies, and working groups, and engaged with the broader industry that relies on our benchmarks and standards and identified a set of priorities and commitments to guide the next phase of our work. These align with our three strategic pillars: Assessments, Technology and Stakeholders. The last 10 years have shown the power of an industry-led benchmark to inspire a collaborative effort to improve ESG transparency across the world. We are proud of the role our members have played in shaping the Assessments and Benchmarks and are committed to finding ways to further integrate their collective intelligence into our work. This starts in 2020, when we will recognize all participants as GRESB Members, opening up new opportunities to be involved in our working groups, committees and governance bodies. Transparency is one of our core values and we are taking steps to improve our Assessment guidance and support so that participants are able to report more accurately and efficiently. Future improvements include providing immediate feedback on calculated variables derived from Assessment inputs, more detailed scoring information and, ultimately, draft scoring within the Portal as well as greater clarity on validation decisions, and their rationale, in the Benchmark Reports. Over time we will add an additional layer of transparency in both the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessment showing where managers are on the journey of including all of their assets in the benchmark. In 2020 we will introduce a new Review Period in the Assessment Cycle to further strengthen the reliability of our Assessments and Benchmark results. The Review Period will start on September 1, when preliminary individual GRESB results will be made available to all participants. During the Review Period, participants will be able to submit a review request to GRESB using a dedicated form. The final results will be launched to both participants and Investor Members on October 1. Public Results events and other results outputs will be rescheduled to October and November in order to accommodate the September Review Period. GRESB has been approached by several institutional investors and asset managers to develop a global ESG benchmark and assessment framework for assessing investments in agriculture, forestry and other real asset verticals. A first step will be to convene an Industry Working Group to discuss the development of the new Assessments. We are also exploring applying our benchmarking methodology and industry-led approach to other asset classes such as private equity or private markets more broadly. Two additional areas we are investigating are government-owned infrastructure and corporate real estate. The investment industry is sharpening its focus on transition and physical risks associated with climate change. Starting in 2020, we are introducing new tools for investors and managers to inform their engagement on these risks and support strategic decision making. The 2020 Real Estate Assessment will include an integration with the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) methodology to show real estate carbon transition pathways at portfolio and asset level to remain within 1.5 and 2.0 degrees of warming. The pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the investments required to transition to a low-carbon economy. GRESB has an important role to play in helping the investment community understand climate-change risks in real asset investments. The CRREM science-based decarbonization targets and pathways can be used to inform our engagement with external investment managers in order to reduce transition risks.” Mathieu Elshout, Senior Director Private Real Estate at PGGM GRESB has an important role to play in helping the investment community understand climate-change risks in real asset investments. The CRREM science-based decarbonization targets and pathways can be used to inform our engagement with external investment managers in order to reduce transition risks.” In parallel, we are upgrading the Real Estate Asset Portal to enable managers to assess the exposure of their assets to physical climate risks. These new services, which are based on integrating geo-coded asset data with third party geospatial risk datasets, will be accessible entirely at the discretion of managers. Our 2019 collaboration with Verisk Maplecroft on a Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard for real estate portfolios, which focuses on physical risk data, is an early example of this approach. Going forward, these integrations will be available directly in the Portal, and will expand to include financial metrics and other third-party datasets. Over time, we envisage introducing an even higher weighting of the Performance Component towards the GRESB Score. The Performance Indicator metrics in the Assessments will be standardized to provide better comparisons and more transparency on actual performance. These changes will be flagged in advance, to give time for the industry to understand and adjust to expectations. With a growing number of our Investor Members interested in understanding their contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and their investments’ ESG impacts and outcomes in general, we are taking steps to ensure our Assessments are aligned with new taxonomies that are being developed. Other important national and global frameworks and targets that investors and managers are seeking to align with include the World Green Building Council’s Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment, the TCFD recommendations, the Paris Climate Agreement, Science Based Targets initiative, EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy and Disclosure Regulations and the International Energy Agency Sustainable Development Scenario. We are committed to supporting these efforts by refining the performance metrics to enable reporting of impacts and outcomes, aligned with these frameworks. Several factors are now converging to facilitate a further evolution in performance data accessibility and reliability in the Assessments and Benchmarks. First, requirements for asset-level reporting in the Performance Component of the Real Estate Assessment will enable us to introduce a new asset-level validation process. Second, we are leveraging advanced technology to put in place more automated error and outlier checks. Third, the expanding API integrations with GRESB data partners are resulting in a more streamlined and robust asset-level performance data reporting process. And fourth, we are moving forward as an industry to define common guidelines for performance data reporting as reflected in the GRESB ESG Data Standard. The sum of these efforts is creating a high-quality ESG performance data flow and global database, from asset-level up, that investors and managers can rely on to better understand risks and opportunities and take appropriate actions. Consistent with developments in the world of ‘big data’, our members are seeking to use their data in more flexible ways. We will provide both tailored solutions around specific products, and greater flexibility for advanced users in the future. These outputs will be developed through close engagement with investors and managers to include customized impact analyses and peer group comparisons; enhanced access to raw data for modeling and time-series analyses through a re-designed data export tool; as well as enhanced portfolio analysis tools, including footprinting based on aggregated asset data. With the 2020 restructuring of the Assessments into separate Management and Performance Components (and Development Component for real estate developers), managers will be able to complete one of the Components and still be part of the benchmark. For example, managers with more opportunistic strategies and those who are constructing a portfolio or raising capital will find value in the Management Component as a way to share structured ESG information with investors. The Management Component will also provide an easier entry point to new participants for whom the reporting burden can be particularly challenging, such as those in emerging markets. While the restructuring will open up the Assessment to new participants, the GRESB Score will only apply to: Real Estate entities completing both the Management and Performance (or the Management and Development Components in the case of developers)Infrastructure Funds participating with at least 25% of their assets in the Infrastructure Asset AssessmentInfrastructure Assets completing both the Management and Performance Components The GRESB Score will continue to underpin the GRESB Ratings and drive the global Benchmarks, just as it does today. Reducing the reporting burden for Assessment participants is not a new imperative for GRESB, but it’s one that requires continued focus. The sheer scale of the transition we are going through as an industry requires an ESG reporting process that is as straightforward and efficient as possible. We are introducing new tools within the Portal to increase reporting efficiencies, improving our alignment with other reporting initiatives and strengthening our capacity in those non-OECD markets where our coverage is still relatively low. In addition, we are building a new online Assessment training program alongside our in-person training to make the content more accessible to managers and partners around the world. We’re in the process of designing a new collaborative research agenda with our members, partners and industry partners. Our extensive ESG coverage of the industry means we are in a unique position to provide deep insights back to the market on the evolving state of sustainability in real assets. Building on initiatives already underway, our 2020 research efforts will focus on providing deeper insights into transition and physical risks associated with climate change. There is also the opportunity to develop a new suite of aggregated benchmarks by sector, region and country relevant for our industry partners, their membership and networks. As an organization with fewer than 30 employees and a relatively small operational footprint, our most significant impacts come from our assessment and benchmarking work and, ultimately, the extent to which we are able to influence investment practices that lead to more sustainable real assets. At the same time, we are committed to managing the impacts from our operations, being transparent about our own performance and taking action to further improve it in the future. We have reported on our operational performance in 10 Years of GRESB. Reflecting our material impacts, we focussed our social reporting on employees and our environmental reporting on our operational GHG emissions. We have taken the step to offset our GHG emissions from staff flights, office energy consumption and staff lunches, estimated for the decade where data is available, by planting two GRESB Forests via the Treedom program. One forest of 802 trees will be located in Kenya. The second forest, in Guatemala, will have 250 trees. Looking forward, we have made a commitment to improving the sustainability of GRESB events and will continue to measure the key indicators highlighted in this report as well as engage more closely with our stakeholders on how best to communicate our impacts and reduce these further in the future. As we look back over what has been a remarkable decade for ESG benchmarking, we are reminded that we are only here today because of the global community that has developed around our shared mission. As investors, lenders, managers, operators, leaders, influencers and experts, you are the ones digging in to ask and answer the tough sustainability questions. You are the ones managing the risks, identifying the opportunities and finding ways to make positive real-world impacts. It’s your efforts that are making the difference. Your decisions that are re-shaping the markets. And your investments that are shaping the future that we and next generations will inherit. The transition to a sustainable real asset industry is one of the most fundamental challenges we face. We can only meet it with reliable ESG information, meaningful global benchmarks and collective action from all our stakeholders as we work towards a more sustainable future.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-verisk-maplecroft-launch-the-climate-risk-resilience-scorecard/,GRESB and Verisk Maplecroft Launch the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard,"Amsterdam and London, November 12, 2019 – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets and Verisk Maplecroft, the leading provider of global ESG, climate and political risk analytics, have jointly launched the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard. Combining Verisk Maplecroft’s global risk analytics with GRESB’s geo-coded asset-data and adaptation measures, the scorecard provides location-specific intelligence on climate change and ESG exposure to create a unique risk-adjusted and asset-level benchmark of global real estate investment. GRESB participants will be able to access powerful new insights into their risk exposure, the competitiveness of their climate and ESG management and resilience, and the global assets they should focus their attention on. It also provides a means of concisely communicating climate-related, ESG and resilience performance, and underlying risk context, to investors. By identifying location-specific climate and ESG risk exposure and management, the Climate Risk & Resilience Scorecard builds on the results of GRESB’s Real Estate Assessment. The methodology has been developed to evaluate how well real estate funds, companies and direct real estate investors manage risks related to climate change, ESG and natural hazards once their underlying risk exposures are taken into account. For the first time, firms managing global real estate assets will be able to understand their exposure, from asset-level up, to a host of climate and ESG factors and what it means for their resilience and ESG management competitiveness”, said Verisk Maplecroft’s Head of Financial Sector Risk James Lockhart Smith. “The needs and expectations of real estate investors are developing rapidly in response to mounting pressures, especially in relation to climate, and we are delighted to be working with GRESB to fill this critical gap in the data landscape.” For the first time, firms managing global real estate assets will be able to understand their exposure, from asset-level up, to a host of climate and ESG factors and what it means for their resilience and ESG management competitiveness”, said Verisk Maplecroft’s Head of Financial Sector Risk James Lockhart Smith. “The needs and expectations of real estate investors are developing rapidly in response to mounting pressures, especially in relation to climate, and we are delighted to be working with GRESB to fill this critical gap in the data landscape.” Creating the new Climate Risk and Resilience Scorecard with Verisk Maplecroft is a significant step towards providing a new set of valuable insights from data already reported to GRESB,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The Scorecard enables managers to demonstrate to investors that they are managing ESG and climate risks and will help with climate-related disclosure requirements, such as the TCFD recommendations.” Creating the new Climate Risk and Resilience Scorecard with Verisk Maplecroft is a significant step towards providing a new set of valuable insights from data already reported to GRESB,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The Scorecard enables managers to demonstrate to investors that they are managing ESG and climate risks and will help with climate-related disclosure requirements, such as the TCFD recommendations.” Learn more about the Scorecard.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/investors-fund-new-initiative-to-assess-climate-change-transition-risk-in-global-real-estate-investment-portfolios/,Investors fund new initiative to assess climate change transition risk in global real estate investment portfolios,"Amsterdam, September 16, 2019 – An investor-led initiative launched today will help real estate investors and managers to assess, manage and mitigate climate risk and to develop climate scenario-based strategies. The research will be carried out by the Austria-based Institute for Real Estate Economics (IIÖ), with the support of GRESB, the ESG Benchmark for Real Assets, and funded by APG, PGGM and Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). The future implementation of carbon regulations consistent with the goal of the Paris agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees or less is one of several plausible scenarios for future climate transition risk. The initiative will develop 1.5 and 2-degree decarbonization pathways for real estate assets by applying global carbon budgets as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Each pathway will extend to 2050 and be comprised of annual estimates of building-related carbon emissions and energy performance – expressed in kWh per m2/ft2 and CO2 per m2/ft2 respectively – aligned with the global warming goals as set out in the Paris agreement. The initiative builds on the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM)* project, funded by the European Commission, which analyzed carbon risk in the European commercial real estate sector earlier this year. This initiative will expand the CRREM project to include major real estate markets outside the EU, and the residential sector. The decarbonization pathways developed for each market and sector can be used as a proxy measure for transition risk and help the real estate industry meet the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). “Decarbonization pathways based on a transparent methodology that is aligned with the Paris Agreement offer a tool for understanding and managing transition risks, enabling investors to benchmark assets and derive significant risk indicators. The positive industry feedback in the CRREM project confirms this conviction and it seems to be the logical next step to extend the approach we developed for EU commercial real estate to further countries and the residential sector.” “Decarbonization pathways based on a transparent methodology that is aligned with the Paris Agreement offer a tool for understanding and managing transition risks, enabling investors to benchmark assets and derive significant risk indicators. The positive industry feedback in the CRREM project confirms this conviction and it seems to be the logical next step to extend the approach we developed for EU commercial real estate to further countries and the residential sector.” Prof Dr Sven Bienert, Managing Director, IIÖ Institute for Real Estate Economics “Property type-specific transition pathways will be an important addition for assessing the ESG performance of both listed and private real estate investment portfolios. The transition pathways enable GRESB to not only assess ESG performance against industry peers, but also against the commitments made in the Paris Climate Agreement. For the wider real estate investment industry, the pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the retrofit investments required to transition to a low carbon economy.” “Property type-specific transition pathways will be an important addition for assessing the ESG performance of both listed and private real estate investment portfolios.

For the wider real estate investment industry, the pathways will be an important tool to understand and mitigate the long-term systemic risk associated with the retrofit investments required to transition to a low carbon economy.” Sander Paul van Tongeren, Managing Director of GRESB The decarbonization pathways will be released for public consultation by February 2020. Relevant market participants, including investors, managers, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), green rating systems and other stakeholders, are encouraged to share their views on the decarbonization pathways and help develop a common language for assessing climate transition risk in real estate.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/esg-reporting-and-benchmarking-in-the-infrastructure-sector-moves-into-the-mainstream/,ESG reporting and benchmarking in the Infrastructure sector moves into the mainstream,"AMSTERDAM, SEP 9, 2019: GRESB, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2019 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. Participation has increased again in 2019 as the sector responds to the growing investor demand for standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their infrastructure funds and assets. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment grew by 43% to include 107 funds. By fund size, the Assessment covers 33 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 75 Infrastructure Investment Managers – participating with at least one fund. Participation in the Infrastructure Asset Assessment increased by 40% to cover 393 assets. The Assessment now covers 30 of the 33 industry sectors across 57 countries, leading to deep data insights for investors, fund managers and asset operators. The Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset was launched this year, providing comprehensive coverage of listed infrastructure companies across the GLIO Global Coverage Index. The data reveals which listed infrastructure companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which perform in the mid-range and which are lagging their peers. There was a 62% increase in assets participating in the Resilience Module, which is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Funds also participated in this module for the first time. The uptick in participation demonstrates an increasing awareness of the need to respond to investor attention on climate risks and resilience. Results highlights 57% of funds participated in the Assessment with more than 25% of their assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score, which is an overall measure of ESG performance at the portfolio level. The average GRESB Fund Score remained level with 2018, at 55 points. The average score decreased in the Asset Assessment, from 47.6 in 2018 to 45.5 in 2019, due to lower scores by newer participants. One in three assets participated for the first time in 2019. Participation increased across all sectors in the Asset Assessment. The best performing sector, with an average GRESB Asset score of 63.2, is Network Utilities, followed by Data Infrastructure (52.5), Diversified (52.8) and Energy and Water Resources (52.7). Data Infrastructure notably moved up the rankings from 2018. Social infrastructure was again the lowest scoring sector (29.0).There are clear regional differences in performance. One third of funds are focused on Europe and another third are globally diversified. Europe also has the largest number of participating assets (60%), but the lowest average asset score (42.1). In line with the pattern for the real estate sector, Oceania assets are leading the pack in scoring, with an average of 55.5. 2019 sees the introduction of performance intensity data in asset benchmark reports. Where reported by participants, data on Health & safety, Energy, Greenhouse gas emissions, Water, Waste, Biodiversity & habitat is provided as intensity metrics with comparisons to peers. This is a significant step towards a standardized approach to measuring and scoring assets across different sectors globally. As more sectors provide sufficient observations, these benchmarking possibilities will help fund managers and asset operators of all sectors and regions to better understand and improve their intensity profiles. “Now in its fourth year, we are delighted that the industry continues to endorse GRESB Infrastructure as demonstrated by sustained growth in participation. Following the proven path of the GRESB Real Estate Assessment, we are becoming the global benchmark. We thank the new and returning participants for their diligence and commitment to reporting and engaging on their ESG performance. While the take-up of GRESB Infrastructure since its launch in 2016 has been positive, this year’s results show that there is still much work to do to scale up reporting and impact,” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We look forward to supporting our participant and investor members to use this fresh data in engagement with stakeholders and to build on this platform to accelerate the transformation towards sustainable infrastructure. Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” “Now in its fourth year, we are delighted that the industry continues to endorse GRESB Infrastructure as demonstrated by sustained growth in participation.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/global-real-estate-sector-improves-esg-performance-but-more-effort-needed-to-reach-global-goals/,Global real estate sector improves ESG performance but more effort needed to reach global goals,"AMSTERDAM, SEP 9, 2019: GRESB, the environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, has released the results for the 2019 GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The results are used by more than 100 institutional investors, representing USD 22 trillion in AUM, to monitor investments, engage with managers, and make decisions that lead to a more sustainable real estate industry. 1,005 property companies, REITs, funds and developers, representing more than USD 4.1 trillion AUM, participated in the 2019 GRESB Assessment. The Assessment now covers more than 100,000 assets, of which more than 66,000 were reported at the asset level. The listed dataset covers 248 entities, representing 65% coverage of the major developed listed real estate indices. The private dataset covers 757 entities, representing 75 of IPE Real Assets’ Top 100 Global Real Estate Investment Managers (participating with at least one fund) and 47 of PERE 100: institutional capital’s top manager picks. The comprehensive nature of the benchmark reveals meaningful global and regional insights and allows us to track the performance of the sector against key national and policy goals such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Paris Climate Agreement, and the net-zero targets laid down by the World Green Building Council (WorldGBC). Global and regional sustainability scores Globally, the average GRESB Score increased from 68 in 2018 to 72 in 2019, demonstrating a sector making strong improvements in overall sustainability performance. Listed property companies still outperform the private sector, but this gap is now negligible compared to previous years. Similarly, while average GRESB scores for offices continue to outperform other property types, the other sectors are closing in.The regional breakdown of GRESB scores show that real estate companies and funds in Oceania continue to lead the world in sustainability performance, a position the region has held for a remarkable 9 years in a row. In 2019, the average GRESB Score for Oceania comes in at 81 (2018: 76), compared to the global average of 72. Notably, more than half of the GRESB 5-star rated portfolios (the highest rating and recognition for being an industry leader) are located in the region. The average GRESB Score for the Asian real estate sector is now 72 (2018: 66). This is close to the global average and second only to Oceania. The listed sector largely accounts for this uptick in performance, significantly outperforming the private real estate sector in the region. This pattern differs from other regions, where sustainability performance is increasing faster in the private sector.Both the European and American real estate sectors have improved average GRESB Scores in 2019. America comes in with a score of 72 (2018: 70), nudging slightly ahead of the European GRESB Score of 71 (2018: 66). Once again, Europe leads the world in transparency with the highest number of entities participating in the benchmark, while the North American GRESB cohort remains the largest in dollar terms globally. More improvement needed to reach global goals With increasing sustainability scores around the world, the data tells the story of a sector stepping up decisively to respond to investor demand for greater ESG transparency and performance. But it’s also clear that more improvements are needed to meet key global goals and achieve the transition to a low-carbon, resilient and more sustainable future.The 2019 results show global like-for-like GHG emissions falling by 2.66%, a lower rate than the 4.91% reduction achieved in the previous year. This slower reduction rate will not be enough to meet the 1.5-degree target set out by the Paris Climate Agreement. After three years of consecutive reductions, global energy consumption increased by 0.20%. And with only three net-zero portfolios in the 2019 benchmark, much more still needs to be done to shift the sector to a sustainable path.At the same time, the 2019 results show many encouraging developments. For example: 88% of GRESB participants have annual performance targets linked to ESG outcomes (up from 83% in 2018)69% of entities now have Board-level financial compensation linked to ESG goals, an important indicator of ESG integration at the highest levels of governance.90% of GRESB participants monitor employee satisfaction, 81% monitor tenant satisfaction and 79% monitor impact on the community, putting the conditions in place for improvements in social aspects of ESG.In its second year, there was a 96% increase in entities participating in the voluntary Resilience Module, which is aligned with the recommendations released by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The uptick in participation demonstrates an increasing awareness of the need to respond to investor attention on climate risks and resilience.Participants are including health and well-being as an explicit component of their ESG strategy. Added to this, our trend analysis for indicators that have remained consistent over the past years shows a significant shift in practice. For example: In 2009, 19% of participants collected energy data. In 2019, it’s 98%In 2009, 13% of participants used renewable energy. In 2019, it’s 61%In 2009, 59% of participants obtained green building certificates, in 2019, it’s 63% at the time of construction and 58% for operational buildingsIn 2011, 39% of participants incorporated sustainable factors in their Board of Directors. In 2019, it’s 41%In 2012, 70% of participants had a senior decision-maker accountable for sustainability, in 2019, it’s 99%In 2012, 26% of participants had sustainability clauses in their lease contracts. In 2019, it’s 86%; “Even in the face of present challenges, we remain optimistic because of the breadth and depth of the sustainability ecosystem that has grown up since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009. Looking back, it has been a remarkable decade of movement building that has laid the groundwork for exponential progress to be made in 2020-2050,” says Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB. “We congratulate all 1,005 companies and funds that reported on their ESG performance this year. The leaders today are building on the important work of their predecessors, just as they pave the way for future efforts to achieve our shared vision for a sustainable real estate sector.” “Even in the face of present challenges, we remain optimistic because of the breadth and depth of the sustainability ecosystem that has grown up since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009.

Over the past three years, the Module demonstrated an increasing level of interest in health and well-being among leading real estate companies and funds. Module participation grew from 174 funds in 2016 to 297 funds in 2018, representing a third of GRESB Real Estate participants. The Module has also demonstrated that companies and funds are able to make meaningful improvements to their health promotion efforts within just a few years. While the GRESB Real Estate Assessment had existing indicators related to aspects of health and safety, the Health & Well-being Module provided an opportunity to test new indicators explicitly focused on the promotion of health and well-being for organizational employees, tenants, and customers. After three years of testing, health and well-being indicators that showed high levels of performance have been moved to the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. GRESB Participants will find a new “Health & Well-being” portion within Stakeholder Engagement with four new health and well-being indicators, two of which are unscored and voluntary in 2019. Additionally, participants are now able to report the presence of health and well-being policies as entity-level policies impacting social issues within the Policy & Disclosure aspect. In the fall, GRESB participants and investors can expect to see a new health portion of the GRESB Benchmark Report which will communicate how a real estate fund performs across all health-relevant GRESB indicators. Check out the new health indicators in the 2019 GRESB Real Estate Assessment and stay tuned for the release of a Green Health Partnership & GRESB Health Report this summer which will provide additional insights from the GRESB Health & Well-being Module."

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-study-by-crrem-on-decarbonization/,New study by CRREM on decarbonization,"New study by CRREM (‘Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor’) shows how the European commercial real estate industry needs to decarbonise by providing a clear roadmap of science-based greenhouse gas emissions targets aligned with the Paris Agreement to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. CRREM defines science-based decarbonization targets and pathways specifically for the commercial real estate industry. Targets are consistent with the EU commitment to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C but for the first time, broken down per country and by eight property types. Current national climate pledges (NDCs) are not enough to meet the Paris goals and could lead to a 2.7 – 3.0°C global warming. More ambitious climate policies are needed and likely to come into force in the future.CRREM emission targets and pathways for individual buildings and portfolios are derived by downscaling the remaining 1.5°/2°C consistent global carbon budget to the EU commercial real estate sector, individual countries and subsectors, for example, office or hotel.European commercial properties will need to reduce their carbon emissions by more than 80% until 2050.The EU commercial real estate sector is 14 years behind schedule: At the current rate of emissions the carbon budget available until 2050 will be fully consumed in 2036.The pathways and targets provide benchmarking roadmaps for individual properties, enabling investors to assess the ‘stranding risk’ of their portfolio and pro-actively address the decarbonisation of their assets."

The index series is an extension of the Dow Jones Select Real Estate Securities Indices (RESI) and utilizes data from GRESB – a leader in evaluating Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) characteristics of real estate companies. At launch, the series consists of the following indices: Dow Jones U.S. Green REIT IndexDow Jones Global Green RESIDow Jones Global ex-U.S. RESIDow Jones Japan Green RESI Each index consists of all the constituents in the relevant regional Dow Jones Select RESI. Constituent weights are adjusted based on the individual company’s sustainability performance as measured by GRESB with higher scoring companies receiving increased weights. Companies ranked below the 50th percentile in sustainability will have their index weight reduced by 30 percent with the additional weight reallocated on a pro-rata basis to the companies ranked in the top 25 percent. As the leading independent index provider, S&P Dow Jones Indices offers a full array of indices to meet any investment strategy. Increasingly, investors are making ESG factors a bigger part of those strategies. With a significant amount of global carbon emissions being driven by the construction and operation of buildings, real estate is a particular industry of focus among ESG investors. “Real estate investors have historically lacked a simple tool to integrate ESG performance into their investment process,” said Michael Orzano, senior director of Global Equity Indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “These indices close that gap by providing a solution that allows market participants to identify companies with strong sustainability performance while retaining the investment characteristics and risk profiles of our conventional real estate benchmarks.” “Real estate investors have historically lacked a simple tool to integrate ESG performance into their investment process,” said Michael Orzano, senior director of Global Equity Indices at S&P Dow Jones Indices. “These indices close that gap by providing a solution that allows market participants to identify companies with strong sustainability performance while retaining the investment characteristics and risk profiles of our conventional real estate benchmarks.” “GRESB exists to respond to investor demand for standardized and validated ESG performance on their real asset investments.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-and-b-capital-partners-pilot-esg-due-diligence-tool-for-infrastructure-assets/,GRESB and B Capital Partners pilot ESG Due Diligence Tool for Infrastructure Assets,"GRESB and B Capital Partners AG joined forces to pilot an ESG due diligence tool for infrastructure asset investments with the goal to develop a standard process to improve both the quality and efficiency of ESG due diligence. B Capital Partners developed a pilot ESG Infrastructure Asset Investment Due Diligence Tool using the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment as a basis. The tool has two goals: for GRESB to offer investors and managers a high quality, on demand ESG due diligence service, supported by its proven platform and processes, in the context of e.g. acquiring new assets or regular assessments of assets for revaluation in annual financial statements, andcontributing to an international ESG due diligence assessment standard by making the tool available as open source, encouraging feedback to improve it further. It is only when the results of ESG assessments are integrated into the business case that they get the appropriate attention. Integrating ESG factors in the due diligence will help to better understand the business in general and investment risks in particular, which in turn enable investors to reduce, mitigate or control certain risks, improve the overall risk/return profile and maximize long-term investment returns. There is currently no internationally accepted ESG-assessment standard for the ESG due diligence of infrastructure assets. This leaves investors to largely judge for themselves what they want to integrate in their evaluations, how to find the data for it, how to quantify the risks and opportunities, and how to publish and use the results. In order to address this problem, B Capital Partners and GRESB conducted an ESG-due diligence pilot on the basis of 10 plus years of infrastructure due diligence experience. During the pilot, the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment was modified to reflect the change of focus from benchmarking to due diligence and adapted to a checklist form. The checklist supports the ESG due diligence process and ensures all ESG risks and opportunities associated with the asset in question are identified. The most material “red-flag” issues are then summarized in the “red-flag” report together with potential mitigation measures. In the future, GRESB plans to integrate this service into its existing, proven platform for ESG Assessment. This will simplify and standardize the process of ESG due diligence for the entire industry – addressing the lack of specific ESG due diligence knowledge and resources among investors. Features of the service are expected to include: online, on demand availability for data input, validation of the submitted data, constantly available “punch lists” and red flag reports, which point to the most material ESG findings, as well as scoring and benchmarking against GRESB’s ever growing database of infrastructure assets, and standardized reporting systems. Once the ESG due diligence document is online, all participants of the infrastructure and investment industry are invited to use the open source standard. The feedback from the industry will be used to refine the methodology and lay the basis for a widely accepted and transparent ESG due diligence standard for infrastructure asset investments. Going forward GRESB will build the Due Diligence Assessment into its online portal and offer this as an online support service. Update June 2020: ESG due diligence tool (ESG DD Tool) for infrastructure assets has been released. Read the announcement.

The Investor Confidence Project’s innovative Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ Certification has been awarded to a waste heat utilisation project at GMS GOURMET GmbH. The project saves natural gas and electricity by using the waste heat of two fast cooling plants to support the heating demand of three ventilation systems at GOURMET’s production site in Vienna. Managing Director Hannes Hasibar emphasizes GOURMET’s leadership when it comes to energy efficiency and innovation: “As a responsible company we treat the earth’s natural resources with care and continuously work on improving efficiency and standards.” Managing Director Hannes Hasibar emphasizes GOURMET’s leadership when it comes to energy efficiency and innovation: “As a responsible company we treat the earth’s natural resources with care and continuously work on improving efficiency and standards.” GOURMET’s appetite for innovation goes hand in hand with ICP Europe’s new Investor Ready Energy Efficiency (IREETM) Certification for industry which delivers high quality projects and safer returns by standardizing how energy efficiency projects are developed, documented and measured. Convinced of the benefits of ICP, energy efficiency specialist denkstatt & enertec became the first registered ICP project developer for industry projects and – together with Austrian ICP partner denkstatt – accompanied GOURMET to have its waste heat recovery project certified as the first industrial project in Europe. Managing Director Christian Schuetzenhofer: “The application of ICP through denkstatt & enertec gives the project owner even more robust, independently verified savings calculations and an additional level of quality assurance. Moreover, it puts more focus on proper project implementation in addition to project development. “ Managing Director Christian Schuetzenhofer: “The application of ICP through denkstatt & enertec gives the project owner even more robust, independently verified savings calculations and an additional level of quality assurance. Moreover, it puts more focus on proper project implementation in addition to project development. “ The project has predicted annual energy savings of 635 MWh in natural gas and 135 MWh in electricity. As project developer, denkstatt & enertec provided the underlying baselining and energy savings calculations and developed implementation plans for Operational Performance Verification (OPV), Operations, Maintenance & Monitoring (OM&M) and Measurement & Verification (M&V) processes. Working closely with denkstatt & enertec, the project’s quality assurance assessor and technical ICP partner Verco applied the ICP Europe Complex Industry Protocol to certify the project.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-2018-in-review-and-the-road-ahead/,GRESB: 2018 in Review and the Road Ahead,"2018 was another inspirational year for GRESB. A growing number of institutional investor members, now controlling assets valued at USD 18 trillion, called on real estate and infrastructure managers to report on their ESG performance. The industry responded decisively, with 903 real estate companies and funds, 75 infrastructure funds and 280 assets stepping forward to participate in the benchmark. 79,000 real estate assets valued at USD 3.5 trillion are now represented, with infrastructure coverage growing to USD 0.6 trillion. The infographic below collects together the highlights of the year in numbers: This process of annual ESG performance benchmarking on such a large scale has built a powerful global ecosystem of investors, managers and industry bodies empowering everyone to work towards a shared vision of sustainable real assets. It’s been a pleasure to see best practices diffuse across the world and witness first-hand the power of capital markets to shift the real asset industry towards a more sustainable path. But even with ESG action accelerating around the world, there is much more work ahead of us. In many ways, the stakes have never been higher for the industry and GRESB to drive forward the sustainability agenda. As we approach 10 years since we launched the inaugural GRESB Real Estate Assessment, it’s time to take stock of our progress and look ahead to the next phase of our work. As an industry-led benchmark, this process begins by soliciting feedback from our governance bodies, listening to member commentary from GRESB working groups, and engaging with the broader industry that relies on our Assessments and benchmarks. Over the years, as GRESB coverage has grown and new use cases have emerged, a consistent theme has come up in our discussions: The need to offer greater reporting flexibility and more customized outputs. The clear message is to add this flexibility while still providing a single, standardized benchmark that can be applied across portfolios of real asset investments globally. Introducing the next generation of ESG benchmarking and disclosure Building on everything we have learned from almost a decade of benchmarking ESG performance, we’re designing a new approach to our Assessments that will provide access to consolidated ESG performance at the portfolio level, underscored by improved data quality at the asset level. The transition will take place progressively from 2020, when both the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments will be divided into two complementary parts: A Management Component and a Performance Component. The two components reflect the existing dimensions of the GRESB model, as well as natural differences in what ESG data is collected by participants, how it is collected, and the type of entity that collects it: The Management Component will focus on entity management, policies and processes, comprising relatively static information collected at the organizational or portfolio level. The Performance Component will cover annual performance data derived from the asset level. The GRESB Score – calculated as a combination of the Management and Performance Components – will remain in place as the ultimate expression of ESG performance. While additional layers of flexibility will be available to both participants and investors, the overall GRESB Score will continue to underpin the GRESB ratings and drive the global benchmark, just as it does today. Figure: The overall GRESB Score calculated as a combination of the Management and Performance Components Improving usability, experience, data quality and analytics The Management Component will open up the Assessments to new participants not yet reporting to GRESB. For example, it will provide a logical first step for participants getting started with their ESG integration (including those in emerging markets), enabling them to become familiar with the GRESB reporting process, identify priority issues and map out their sustainability program. New mandates that are raising capital, undergoing due diligence, or constructing a portfolio will also find value in the Management Component as a way to share structured ESG information with investors during the fundraising process (thereby replacing the current Real Estate Pre-Assessment). The Performance Component will enable us to introduce a new suite of data-driven benchmarking tools and flexible outputs for participants seeking more granular asset-level insights. For example, the ability to create customized peer groups, compare sub-portfolios, and explore the contribution of an individual asset to portfolio environmental or social outcomes and impacts. This means creating simple, at-a-glance views in the GRESB Portal of specific metrics that a participant is interested in, together with new aggregated data insights for investors. This new Assessment structure will extend the reporting timeline, reducing pressure on participants to report only during a three-month window. The goal is to significantly reduce the reporting burden via streamlined asset-level performance data updates in the Performance Component (e.g., by using GRESB API connections) while requiring regular updates to the more static organizational information reported via the Management Component. For our institutional investor members, splitting the Assessments into the two component parts will allow us to create more tailored and context-appropriate analytics. Some GRESB investor members are now seeking tailored portfolio reports using custom indicators, or KPIs aligned with initiatives such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the TCFD recommendations as well as other broad-based reporting frameworks such as GRI, PRI and SASB. Others are looking for enhanced portfolio foot-printing based on accurate, aggregated portfolio level data and alignment with investor-led initiatives to tackle climate change. We’re also receiving interest in using flexible aspect weightings in the Portfolio Analysis tool, along with the ability to define materiality for different investment strategies and portfolio construction approaches. Benchmarking real-world performance and impact The way ESG factors are being adopted into mainstream investment decisions continues to evolve. We’re already starting to see new models of investor behavior from our member base that integrate measures of impact alongside risk and return. The division of our Assessments into the two component parts will enable us to better support this market trend. Specifically, management inputs and outputs (e.g. policies put in place and measures taken at the organizational level with the intent to improve ESG performance) will be addressed by the Management Component. The outcomes and impacts realized by these actions will be captured in the Performance Component. The diagram below illustrates this progression. Figure: GRESB Assessment Structure 2020 While measuring impact is not an easy task, an industry consensus is slowly coming into view on how best to do this. We’re seeing this among our Investor Members where there is an emerging convergence toward aligning with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the TCFD recommendations. This is an evolving area and we are focused on working closely with our members and the broader industry to ensure our indicators are firmly aligned with the most important frameworks and designed to help participants understand their impacts and progress toward targets. We will underscore this keener focus on performance in two ways: First, by progressively placing a higher weighting of the Performance Component towards the overall GRESB Score and second, by introducing a requirement for asset-level reporting. This dual approach will provide multiple industry benefits including new granular analytics for participants, increased investor confidence in the quality of reported ESG data, and better benchmarks of sector progress at the aggregate level. In addition, with ESG risks becoming more acute and material to long-term performance, expectations around quality and validation are growing. That’s why we have started the process of developing a new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard to define the rules for high-quality data reporting. The Standard will draw on best practices and principles in data quality used by experts across different industries, applying them to ESG data to complement our existing validation processes. Read more on the GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard. Focus areas for 2019 In 2019, we will engage with a broad cross-section of industry leaders, advance critical global conversations with our investors, participants and partners, and establish the building blocks for the GRESB Assessments from 2020 onwards. A crucial success factor will be the constructive collaboration between all our stakeholders as we work together to raise the bar for global ESG performance benchmarking. Our focus areas align with the three strategic pillars that guide our planning process: Stakeholders, Technology and Assessments. 1. Stakeholders: Investors, Participants and Partners Ever since GRESB came into predominance as an initiative of a group of institutional investors, we have developed our strategy in direct dialogue with the industry. GRESB has grown tremendously since the inaugural Assessment in 2009, as has our membership community, which now brings together the collective wisdom of the world’s leading investors, managers, consultants, industry associations and data providers. Honoring our industry-driven legacy and the role our members play in defining ESG concepts for our sector, we are committed to providing greater opportunities for GRESB Members to contribute their leadership in shaping our Assessments and benchmarks. To facilitate this, we will be making clearer distinctions between participants and Members, laying the groundwork for a more intuitive organizational structure that provides greater long-term value to our stakeholders. 2. Technology: IT & Analytics Platform and Portal The rapid advances of technology and big data taking place across the real asset industry are a rich source of opportunity for GRESB and benchmark participants. Together we’re creating a comprehensive industry-specific ESG performance data ecosystem, as well as the assurance structure and science to make it reliable and meaningful. This past year GRESB significantly invested in our data science and platform development capabilities. This coming year we will continue to further invest in the platform to improve usability, experience, data quality and analytics. 3. GRESB Assessments: Real Estate, Infrastructure and Debt GRESB Real Estate participants should expect enhancements to asset-level reporting functionality and the integration of selected Health & Well-being Module elements. Developments to the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment will include aligning sector classifications to industry standards, refinements to the materiality-based scoring process, and further standardization of Performance Indicators to ensure greater comparability of performance data within and across sectors. The Infrastructure Fund Assessment will benefit from a redesigned Fund-Asset linkage in the Portal. The Resilience Module will enter its second year with a strengthened scoring model and new indicators aligned with TCFD recommendations. In late 2019, we plan to release the first version of the new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard designed to provide industry guidance for high-quality data reporting. The goal of the Standard is to reduce reporting and validation efforts, while at the same time improving the reliability and quality of ESG data used and reported by the industry. Over the last four years, the GRESB Debt Assessment has rated and ranked the quality of ESG integration among real estate lenders. While a motivated cohort of banks, real estate debt funds and mortgage REITs have found benefit from participating, the Debt Assessment in its current form does not enable investors or participants to evaluate the overall performance of portfolios where debt investments are held alongside real estate assets. Therefore, in place of a standalone Debt Assessment, we will work with lenders to monitor their real estate and infrastructure investments using the GRESB Real Estate and/or Infrastructure Assessments. In parallel, we are in discussions with several partners to evaluate whether they are interested in continuing the Debt Assessment. Thank you for your support: past, present and future None of the success and growth that we’ve experienced over the last nine years would have been possible without you: the institutional investors, fund managers, portfolio companies, property developers, asset operators and owners, industry partners, academic researchers, data partners and other leaders from around the globe who have supported GRESB by joining our shared vision. We also owe a great debt to past and current members of the GRESB Board of Directors, along with our Advisory Boards, Regional Benchmark Committees and Industry Working Groups without whom the GRESB Assessments and benchmarks would not have achieved the industry standing they enjoy today. Everyone at GRESB is thankful for your leadership, and with you, we look forward to a more sustainable future. Here’s to a happy and impactful 2019 and beyond.

With collaboration embedded in the DNA of both organizations, the MOU will create the basis for coordination, alignment and mutual recognition between the GRESB Infrastructure Assessment and the IS Rating Tools. The vision is to provide asset managers and operators with one “process” that facilitates both reporting to the GRESB Infrastructure Asset Assessment and applying for an IS Operations rating. GRESB and ISCA will collaborate to streamline connections between IS project and asset operations ratings and GRESB assessments for companies and assets with the aim of reducing participant reporting burden, enhancing data validation processes, and maximizing value. ISCA and GRESB will also work together to advance the rigor of the conversation about sustainable infrastructure, which will result in a joint output. “We have an obligation to accelerate and enable sustainability wherever we possibly can, and by partnering with GRESB, we are creating more pathways, making sustainability even more accessible for the infrastructure industry,” said Ainsley Simpson, ISCA CEO. “We’re big advocates of increasing the alignment between sustainability guidelines, frameworks and rating tools in the infrastructure sector. We are excited by this opportunity to work with ISCA to provide greater clarity on what constitutes sustainable performance in infrastructure investments, which then serves as the base for the industry’s collective efforts to help drive improvements,“ said Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure, GRESB. About ISCA The Infrastructure Sustainability Council of Australia (ISCA) is a certified social enterprise, member-based not-for-profit and the peak industry body for advancing sustainability outcomes in infrastructure. ISCA’s purpose is to accelerate sustainability in infrastructure. ISCA’s values which drive our culture of value creation are: Collaboration | Passion | Change | Knowledge The principle means by which ISCA is advancing sustainability outcomes in infrastructure is through; the development and facilitation of the IS rating scheme, building capacity of industry through training and workshops, engaging industry stakeholders through a community of practice and driving innovation."

CRREM now launched its website, which aims to help investors measure, understand and reduce carbon risks inherent to commercial real estate portfolios. This month has been a wake-up call for investors and policy makers on the risks posed by climate change: The IPCC[1] declares that limiting global warming to 1.5°C is strictly necessary to prevent severe damage to global ecosystems, while the world is heading to 3°C degrees under current projections. The report stresses that the world “requires rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes” and especially “transitions in land, buildings and cities.” The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science was awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer for their research on the economics of climate change and sustainable development. The One Planet Summit saw global leaders underscore 12 commitments related to financing climate resilience. The Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco highlighted how local and regional private and public are increasingly committing to climate action. Contrary to the announcement by EU commissioner for climate action and energy Mr. Miguel Arias Cañete in August 2018, the EU has not voted in tougher GHG pledges and plans to stick to the reduction target of 40 % (instead of 45 %) until 2030 (compared to 1990). The world has an estimated remaining carbon budget of 750 billion tons of carbon to limit global warming below 2 degrees compared to preindustrial levels. Given annual emissions of about 40 billion tons, the global budget will be consumed within less than 20 years. The IPCC as well as the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimate that global emissions will have to peak before 2020 and then trail off steeply if we are to comply with the Paris Agreement. Given that the real estate and construction sector accounts for 30-40 % of all emissions, energy efficiency improvements in real estate are posed to play a pivotal part in curbing global carbon emissions. Understanding the necessary decarbonisation pathways and climate risks is vital for owners of real estate assets. As one of the largest real estate investment managers in Europe, Aberdeen Standard Investments is contributing to this important project which will help investors better understand and act on climate-related financial risk.’ Ruairi Revell (ESG Manager, Real Estate) | Aberdeen Standard Life Understanding the necessary decarbonisation pathways and climate risks is vital for owners of real estate assets. As one of the largest real estate investment managers in Europe, Aberdeen Standard Investments is contributing to this important project which will help investors better understand and act on climate-related financial risk.’ Ruairi Revell (ESG Manager, Real Estate) | Aberdeen Standard Life CRREM conducted an initial industry survey representing EUR 260 billion assets under management to understand how European Real Estate Investors currently measure and reduce carbon risks. The survey showed that while the industry has made significant progress over the last years, there is still much room for improvement. For 50% of the investors, decarbonization is rudimentary or still not a board room topic, 18% do not perform any carbon risk assessments for their portfolio and 32% only partially. Digging deeper, most market participants stated that they currently only focus on operational carbon from buildings. Given that the entire building and construction supply chain needs to be decarbonized, ‘embodied carbon’ (e.g. emissions from production, transportation and disposal of building materials and the construction) and therefore more advanced techniques like LCA and WLC need to be increasingly promoted. The new IPCC-report clearly stresses that all impacts of the real estate industry – regardless if carbon emissions are direct or indirect – must reach zero by 2050. Respondents also made a clear statement regarding their motivation for energetic retrofits: it’s either compliance with regulation (60%) or higher profits (74%). This is an important finding for policy makers to select the “right” instruments to trigger higher retrofitting rates for the existing building stock. Interestingly 60% of market participants state that their internal targets are already higher than what is presently required by regulation. 74% are even aiming to increase their financial budget for retrofits within the next five years significantly. Within the European Union, buildings are responsible for approx. 36% of emissions. As 75% of the EU’s building stock is estimated to be energy inefficient according to current technological standards, environmental regulation in the property sector offers regulators quick wins to reduce emissions. A large number of buildings in the EU will face significant markdowns if retrofit efforts fail to meet rising energy and carbon requirements. Already 24% of the investors stated that they would require a risk-premium for properties with a poor carbon footprint. 15% even consider disinvestment of buildings with poor performing carbon profiles. CRREM will help investors to identify ‘stranding risks’ of inefficient assets to facilitate carbon efficient investment in retrofits. The term ‘Stranding risk’ denotes the risk of premature write-downs or devaluations due to, for example, strengthened carbon regulation or market expectations regarding energy efficiency. Sustainable development is only possible, if we draw the full potential of carbon reduction in the building sector and if investors are aware of the risks entailed by buildings that do not meet climate protection targets.’ Roger Baumann | COO and Head Sustainability Global Real Estate | Credit Suisse Asset Management (CH) Sustainable development is only possible, if we draw the full potential of carbon reduction in the building sector and if investors are aware of the risks entailed by buildings that do not meet climate protection targets.’ Roger Baumann | COO and Head Sustainability Global Real Estate | Credit Suisse Asset Management (CH) 43% of companies responding to the CRREM industry survey stated that they are not familiar with the term ‘stranded asset’, even though enhanced regulation to promote energy efficiency is foreseeable, exposing investors with energy-inefficient buildings to the downside risks of stricter building codes, carbon taxes, and related hikes in energy prices. The CRREM research consortium consists of five EU-based institutions experienced in the field of carbon research in real estate: GRESB, University of Alicante, Ulster University, IIÖ Institute for Real Estate Economics and Tilburg University’s TIAS Business School. While the 2018 GRESB Assessment results show that 71.2% of European property companies and REITs undertake an asset level carbon risk assessment before new acquisitions, and 65.3% do so for standing assessments, there is still no common framework for measuring carbon risks at an asset level within the European Union. By establishing this framework, CRREM will enable investors to better understand the climate-related financial risk present within their portfolio.’Sander Paul van Tongeren | Co-Founder and Managing Director | GRESB.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/north-american-real-estate-sector-keeps-moving-forward-with-the-job-of-improving-sustainability-performance/,North American real estate sector keeps moving forward with the job of improving sustainability performance,"Once again, North America’s average GRESB Score – a measure of overall sustainability performance – is higher than the global average. More North American real estate companies and funds completed the new Resilience module than in other regions. 13 Sector Leaders named for their sustainability leadership in 2018. Amsterdam September 20 – In 2018, GRESB scored and benchmarked the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of 220 North American real estate funds and companies on behalf of more than 75 institutional investors. While the number of European entities participating in the 2018 benchmark is larger, at US$ 1.5 billion in total Assets Under Management, the North American GRESB cohort is still the largest in dollar terms globally. The North America real estate sector improved its sustainability performance again this year, with the regional average GRESB Score breaking the 70 mark, up from 64 in 2017. This is higher than the global average (68) and second only to Australia and New Zealand (76). However, when it comes to energy consumption, GHG emissions and water consumption, the average year-on-year reductions posted by the North American sector fell behind global averages. North American entities reported a 1.8% reduction in energy consumption (compared to a 2.5% global reduction); GHG emissions are down 2.9% in the region (globally, emissions are down 4.9%), and water consumption increased by 0.3%, compared to a global fall of 0.5%. 42 companies and funds in North America completed the new voluntary Resilience Module, which is more than in any other regions and a sign that the sector is quickly waking up to the importance of managing long-term resilience risks. These efforts are not surprising given rising interest from institutional investors and the growing costs of unusual weather-related damage in the US and around the world. “The collective industry leadership exhibited by the record number of GRESB participants in North America reinforces the real estate industry’s strong ESG momentum and continued progress,” remarked Dan Winters, GRESB Head of Americas. “With overall sustainability scores increasing once again the industry is getting on with the job of improving sustainability performance and communicating this to investors.” “Property managers from outside of the USA, in Canada and Mexico, also showed improvements. There was an increase in both average scores and the number of participants from Canadian entities, who have long showed leadership in the region.” notes Neil Pegram, Director of Americas. “Participation in GRESB has grown again in 2018 as investors seek standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their real estate assets,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “This investor interest, backed up with accurate performance benchmarking, is empowering the spread of sustainable best practices across the world.

Levels of public ESG disclosure rise sharply among listed property companies and REITs . 11 Sector Leaders named for their sustainability leadership in 2018. Amsterdam, September 20 – In 2018, GRESB scored and benchmarked the environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance of 137 Asian real estate funds, companies and developers on behalf of more than 75 institutional investors. The regional average GRESB Score increased from 63 in 2017 to 66 in 2018, demonstrating a sector making improvements in overall sustainability performance. The improvements are most notable in the listed sector, with the average score for listed entities in Asia (71) coming in higher than the global average (69). The non-listed sector, scoring 62, was slightly lagging the global average (67), indicating that private entities in Asia will have to work harder to keep up with global improvements on ESG performance. The increasing attention being placed on sustainability by the listed sector in Asia is also apparent in the rapidly growing levels of public ESG disclosures. Entities in Japan and Hong Kong in particular responded decisively to the growing regulatory and market demands for increased ESG transparency, with a marked uptick in public ESG disclosure levels compared to 2017. Average year-on-year energy consumption for the Asia real estate sector fell by 6.0% – more than in other regions and significantly exceeding the 2.5% worldwide average reduction. Like-for-like GHG emissions were down 3.8%, with water consumption falling 0.8% in the region. “2018 has seen the commitment to improving environmental and social outcomes grow strongly in Asia in response to increasing investor and regulatory demands for better ESG risk management and higher levels of transparency,” says Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB. “On the environmental front, the reductions in energy consumption stand out, sending a positive message to investors in a sector where efficiency and financial performance go hand in hand. This is supported by initiatives such as the Super Low Energy Program that was recently announced by Singapore’s Building and Construction Authority. The Program promotes the importance of environmental sustainability.” “Social sustainability is also getting more recognition, as industry stakeholders acknowledge the positive impact of the built environment for individuals and communities.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/gresb-measurabl-partner-to-improve-esg-data-quality-for-real-assets/,"GRESB, Measurabl Partner to Improve ESG Data Quality for Real Assets","Global real assets benchmarking authority teams up with software pioneer to raise the bar on ESG data quality. AMSTERDAM (September 19, 2018) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, and Measurabl, the world’s most widely adopted software for real estate sustainability data management, have formed a partnership to create a new GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard and Quality Metric in order to elevate and enable the use of sustainability data in any commercial real estate transaction. The GRESB ESG Data Quality Standard will be open to all sustainability software companies for the built environment. GRESB Global Partners and GRESB Premier Partners will have the exclusive opportunity to be part of a Data Quality Technical Working Group to provide input and share their expertise with the goal of creating an objective, open standard that will be widely adopted by the industry. Over 900 real estate companies and property funds representing some 79,000 assets valued in excess of USD $3.5 trillion report to GRESB annually, with Measurabl being a primary data partner. Measurabl alone tracks ESG performance on more than 6 billion square feet worth of real estate spread across 70 countries. With GRESB, the two encompass the largest and most comprehensive real estate benchmarking database in the world. “Our goal is to elevate the trust in and credibility of ESG reporting,” explained Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director of GRESB. “As a result, real estate stakeholders will have the confidence to act on ESG data.” Doug Hodge, former CEO of PIMCO, one of the world’s largest investment managers with $1.75 trillion in assets, said, “ESG data is foundational to a well-functioning capital market. Since real estate is such a significant asset class, it will benefit disproportionately from GRESB and Measurabl’s leadership on data quality and building benchmarking.” “Our goal is to elevate the trust in and credibility of ESG reporting,” explained Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director of GRESB. “As a result, real estate stakeholders will have the confidence to act on ESG data.” Doug Hodge, former CEO of PIMCO, one of the world’s largest investment managers with $1.75 trillion in assets, said, “ESG data is foundational to a well-functioning capital market. Since real estate is such a significant asset class, it will benefit disproportionately from GRESB and Measurabl’s leadership on data quality and building benchmarking.” Sustainability, often referred to using the acronym ESG for “environmental, social, governance,” is used by businesses and investors in creating and executing strategies seeking superior financial returns with less risk. It is a key component of real estate investment, lending, insurance, and leasing decisions for which GRESB is by far the most used ESG benchmark. “Real estate is the world’s largest sector, so it can and should take the lead in elevating trust in its ESG reporting,” said Matt Ellis, Measurabl’s Founder and CEO, and former Director of Sustainability Solutions at CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company. “Real estate is the world’s largest sector, so it can and should take the lead in elevating trust in its ESG reporting,” said Matt Ellis, Measurabl’s Founder and CEO, and former Director of Sustainability Solutions at CBRE, the world’s largest commercial real estate services company. Sustainability is particularly relevant to real estate since it is one of the world’s most polluting industries, responsible for nearly 71% of US electricity consumption, 39% of carbon emissions, 14% of potable water usage, and 40% of raw materials usage. People spend 90% of their time indoors – the health and well-being implications of which are only now being understood and addressed using technologies like Measurabl. “Data quality is king when it comes to real estate transactions,” said Ray Wirta, former CEO of CBRE and current President of The Irvine Company, one of the largest landowners and developers in the US. “I commend Measurabl and GRESB for pioneering the next step in making ESG something real estate professionals can act upon.” “Data quality is king when it comes to real estate transactions,” said Ray Wirta, former CEO of CBRE and current President of The Irvine Company, one of the largest landowners and developers in the US. “I commend Measurabl and GRESB for pioneering the next step in making ESG something real estate professionals can act upon.” GRESB will coordinate and lead a Data Quality Technical Working Group with the purpose of defining, launching, and maintaining a data quality regime in the GRESB Real Estate and Infrastructure Assessments. Measurabl is the Founding Partner of the Working Group and will contribute its Investment Grade™ data methodologies and benchmarks as well as software tools for calculating and displaying data quality metrics. The Partners expect to take one year to develop the Data Quality Standard followed by a year-long pilot period exclusively facilitated by Measurabl. As part of the partnership agreement, GRESB and Measurabl will also jointly host an annual “Leaders in Data Quality” Award where top performers in data quality are recognized. ***** About GRESB GRESB is the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets.

New sector-based materiality scoring tailors the assessment to different infrastructure sectors creating a globally recognized foundation for benchmarking assets on their performance. Moving to standardized sector intensity metrics will give investors comparable data and an ESG framework they can apply to all their investments. 48% increase in funds participating in the Infrastructure Assessment with their underlying assets. 22 Sector Leaders are named for their sustainability leadership and commitment. Amsterdam September 13, 8:00 AM CEST- GRESB, the global environmental, social and governance (ESG) benchmark for real assets, today released the global results for the 2018 GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. The infrastructure sector is responding strongly to the ever-increasing investor calls for greater transparency on ESG performance. Now in its third year, the infrastructure assessment has reached “critical mass” with strong growth in participation – a 75% increase in assets and 17% for funds compared to last year. Notable in this year’s benchmark is the 48% increase in funds participating in the Infrastructure Assessment with their underlying assets. This enables the funds to obtain the GRESB Fund Score (the ultimate measure of Fund ESG performance for investors). “Now in its third year, we are delighted that the industry has endorsed GRESB Infrastructure by growing participation significantly. We are now well on the way to emulating the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and becoming the global standard,” says Rick Walters, Director Infrastructure at GRESB. “We thank the new and continuing participants for their diligence and congratulate them for improving their performance individually and as an industry. We look forward to supporting our investor members to use this fresh data to engage with their funds and assets and enhance their decision making. Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is surely one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” “Now in its third year, we are delighted that the industry has endorsed GRESB Infrastructure by growing participation significantly.

Whilst the global infrastructure and SDG gaps are large and formidable, strong ESG performance is surely one of the keys to unlocking further infrastructure funding and bridging these gaps.” This year materiality-based scoring was introduced across the Asset Assessment ensuring that participants were assessed on the ESG issues material to their sector. This work not only has created a foundation for benchmarking assets on their performance but is also providing highly relevant ESG data and insights to the infrastructure market. GRESB infrastructure participants are increasingly reporting on their energy and greenhouse gas emissions and starting to set improvement targets. This increased reporting is allowing GRESB to begin to set sector standards for intensity metrics that provide investors with comparable data they can use to monitor all their investments. “Participation in GRESB has grown again in 2018 as investors seek standardized and validated ESG data to assess the sustainability of their real estate assets,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “This investor interest, backed up with accurate performance benchmarking, is empowering the spread of sustainable best practices across the world.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/preliminary-results-on-esg-transparency-of-listed-infrastructure-firms/,Preliminary Results on ESG Transparency of Listed Infrastructure Firms,"GRESB launched a new Infrastructure Public Disclosure dataset to measure the ESG transparency of listed infrastructure companies. GRESB Infrastructure Analyst David Tassadogh’s article on the results of the pilot study was published in GLIO Journal. This pilot study on the level of public ESG disclosure of 71 listed infrastructure firms within the GLIO Global Coverage led to preliminary results suggesting that the infrastructure asset class performs better overall in comparison with real estate. Disclosure on seven ESG aspects across 22 indicators was analyzed and awarded points which resulted in a Public Disclosure Level from A-E. [one-half-first] The infrastructure asset class (using GLIO Global Coverage as the representation) has a high level of public ESG disclosure. More than 60% of firms achieved an A or B as their disclosure level The strongest scores came from European constituents [/one-half-first] [one-half] North American constituents scored lowest with 48% of total points Asia Pacific region averaged 60% of total points available Airport sector displayed the highest average ESG disclosure level [/one-half] Preliminary results suggest that overall, infrastructure companies do a better job on ESG disclosure than their listed real estate counterparts. Comparing the main regions, European infrastructure companies lead the way with companies in Asia Pacific close behind. Americas’ ESG disclosure level was the weakest of the three regions; a result consistent with GRESB’s Real Estate Public Disclosure evaluation.Although these are preliminary results based on a limited sample size, GRESB intends on expanding the analysis in the coming year to capture the entire GLIO Global Coverage."

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/a-liquid-global-sustainable-reits-index-by-reitsmarket/,A Liquid Global Sustainable REITs Index By Reitsmarket,"Brussels, June 7, 2018 – Reitsmarket launches its new global sustainable REITs index. After the successful launch of the Euronext® Reitsmarket Global Balanced Index and the Euronext® Reitsmarket Global Conviction Index in October last year, Reitsmarket now offers investors access to a sustainable alternative. Both the existing Global and Conviction indices, launched in October last year, continue to build a superb track record. Performance since October is 3.62% and 2.03% respectively, above the 1.94% level for the benchmark. Annualized volatility levels at 9.1% and 9.7% respectively are substantially below the 11.2% level for the benchmark. This year Reitsmarket started a cooperation with GRESB, the global sustainability benchmark and reporting standard for real assets. The Euronext® Reitsmarket GRESB Global Sustainable Index is the first index resulting from this new venture. The ERGS index is designed to track specific factor trends in sustainable listed real estate worldwide. It is represented by 30 global real estate securities.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/mind-the-gap-epra-gresb-close-in-on-shared-sustainability-language/,"Mind the Gap: EPRA, GRESB, close in on shared sustainability language","The European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA) and the real estate sustainability benchmarking organization GRESB have completed the comparative Gap analysis of EPRA’s latest Sustainability Best Practices Recommendations (sBPR) Guidelines with the 2018 GRESB Real Estate Assessment that encompasses public and private equity property investments. The Gap analysis concludes that the industry represented by both bodies is, in the main, converging on common definitions of ESG performance in real estate, though further consolidation still needs to be achieved. EPRA and GRESB have recently updated their own frameworks to introduce new social and corporate governance indicators, such as gender diversity, health and safety of employees and assets, to provide investors with a wider set of information to monitor and manage the ESG risks and opportunities of their investments. The extension of the two organizations’ reporting scope was the catalyst for initiating the Gap analysis across their respective guidelines. Hassan Sabir, EPRA Director of Finance said: “There are a bewildering number of standards and frameworks for measuring and disclosing ESG performance in the market, so this first Gap analysis between the two most recognized initiatives in our industry, is an important step towards ensuring we all use and understand a common language and metrics.” Hassan Sabir, EPRA Director of Finance said: “There are a bewildering number of standards and frameworks for measuring and disclosing ESG performance in the market, so this first Gap analysis between the two most recognized initiatives in our industry, is an important step towards ensuring we all use and understand a common language and metrics.” EPRA and GRESB’s Gap analysis streamlines and unifies the number of data sets companies, investors and regulators need to use to make informed and responsible decisions. Corporate and fund management sustainability officers were repeatedly required to complete multiple surveys on their corporate and portfolio performances for often the same overlapping, or perhaps incomparable data. A huge amount of time and costs could be saved if the industry was working from fewer and more unified methodologies, so all stakeholders including companies, investors and regulators would be confident that common definitions and comparable data are used for informed and responsible investments. EPRA and GRESB have always taken similar approaches to disclosing performance data (e.g. energy consumption data) in real estate portfolios. With the new iteration of the GRESB Assessment, the alignment in terminology and interpretation of data becomes stronger as GRESB adopts the concepts of “Landlord and tenant obtained consumption”. Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB said: “The 2018 publicly available gap analysis between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the EPRA sBPR is testament to our shared mission for sector transparency. Our long-standing collaboration is not only reflected in the common language we use, but also in the topics we identify as material for the real estate industry.” Roxana Isaiu, Director Real Estate at GRESB said: “The 2018 publicly available gap analysis between the GRESB Real Estate Assessment and the EPRA sBPR is testament to our shared mission for sector transparency.

The link unlocks the capability to locate, select and match valid BREEAM certificate entries to specific assets within a GRESB portfolio and help to improve the speed and accuracy of reporting for clients. GRESB participants can already link building certifications via the ‘Certification’ tab within the Asset Portal. However, the addition of the BREEAM certification dataset via the newly introduced API provides another layer of transparency and efficiency to GRESB reporting. The new functionality will be live for the 2018 GRESB reporting period and is the first step in connecting GRESB to a BREEAM certification dataset in this way. Further functionality will be added over time as the two organisations continue to build stronger linkages. “The integration of the BREEAM API marks an important milestone for the industry as it enables seamless and assured reporting of BRE certifications to GRESB. It also represents another step forward in our ambitions to reduce the reporting burden for our respondents” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-founder and Managing Director at GRESB. James Fisher, Existing Buildings Lead for BREEAM, said “The API demonstrates the strong synergy between GRESB as a portfolio-based reporting tool and BREEAM as a more granular asset-based reporting and certification methodology.

Promoted by the Long Term Infrastructure Investors Association (LTIIA), this study, will be based on data from GRESB Infrastructure and EDHEC Infrastructure Institute. The study is also part of the EDHEC/LTIIA research chair in the investment characteristics of unlisted infrastructure equity investments. It will be published as an EDHEC Infrastructure Institute publication in 2019. How ESG affects the financial performance has been an important question for many infrastructure investors. This project will help us understand better what the actual market facts are,” said Eugene Zhuchenko, Executive Director, LTIIA. How ESG affects the financial performance has been an important question for many infrastructure investors. This project will help us understand better what the actual market facts are,” said Eugene Zhuchenko, Executive Director, LTIIA. GRESB collects and analyses data on the ESG characteristics of infrastructure investments through an annual Infrastructure Assessment. Likewise, EDHEC Infrastructure Institute collects and analyses data about the financial performance of infrastructure investments and produces performance benchmarks for private infrastructure debt and equity. As a result, combining the data and analyses made by GRESB and the EDHEC Infrastructure Institute provides the opportunity for one of the first empirical studies of the potential relationship between the financial performance of infrastructure investments and ESG characteristics. Frederic Blanc-Brude, Director, EDHEC infrastructure Institute said, “This is the first time we can match financial and ESG performance data and explore the link between these two aspects of infrastructure investment. It promises to be a fascinating study.” Frederic Blanc-Brude, Director, EDHEC infrastructure Institute said, “This is the first time we can match financial and ESG performance data and explore the link between these two aspects of infrastructure investment. It promises to be a fascinating study.” Study outline The study will begin with a review of the various theoretical underpinnings of the hypotheses to be tested i.e. why ESG and financial characteristics may or may not be related. This will be followed by an econometric analysis of the relationship between various financial metrics and ESG characteristics. Testing various models the study will review whether adding ESG characteristics to a model of the risk-adjusted financial performance of infrastructure investments can improve the explanatory power of the model.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/data-is-clear-a-higher-gresb-score-corresponds-with-a-higher-return-for-european-non-listed-funds/,Data is Clear: A higher GRESB Score corresponds with a higher return for European non-listed funds,"A 10 point higher GRESB total score corresponds with a 34 basis points higher annual fund return. That’s the key takeaway from the research paper by Dirk Brounen (Tilburg University) and Maarten van der Spek, July 2017, published by TIAS. The research analyzed the performance of almost 340 European non-listed real estate funds representing well over 200 billion Euros of gross asset value. It examined the relationship between GRESB scores – which provide an overall measure of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance – and INREV returns in order to shed light on non-listed fund performance. The research found that: Early GRESB adopters tend to be larger funds with above average returns, GRESB scores improve the understanding of non-listed fund performance, The link between GRESB scores and higher fund returns strengthens when a time lag is added, and In the absence of fund information, GRESB scores help as an alternative for good governance. This research matters because it adds to the long line of evidence that strong ESG practices in the real estate sector can help drive better performance and shareholder returns over time. This link is driving real estate investors to increasingly consider ESG as a way to identify portfolio risk and opportunity. It also underlines the importance for real estate companies and funds to report more ESG data to the market and engage with investors on their performance. View the full report here."
https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/new-data-platform-shows-that-listed-gresb-participants-are-more-transparent-about-their-esg-performance-than-other-listed-property-companies-and-reits/,New data platform shows that listed GRESB participants are more transparent about their ESG performance than other listed property companies and REITs,"Ever since the inaugural Real Estate Assessment in 2009, the idea behind GRESB has never wavered: to provide transparency on the sustainability performance of real estate funds and companies so that investors can factor portfolio risks and opportunities into their decision making. This commitment continues today with the release of the new Public Disclosure Snapshot and data platform measuring the level of material environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure by the listed property sector. For the first time we are able to assess any REIT or listed property company, not just those that participate in the GRESB Real Estate Assessment. The new dataset was created in response to increasing demand from institutional investors for ESG disclosure across the entire FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index and GPR 250 index. It uses 22 indicators that focus on the topics covered by REITs and listed companies in their commitment to publicly inform stakeholders about material ESG issues. Combined, the indicators provide a Public Disclosure Level expressed through a sliding scale from A to E. A-level companies are the most transparent with a high level of ESG disclosure, while E-level companies are the least transparent with little or no ESG disclosure. Each entity is placed within a comparison group based on country/region, property sector and market value to provide a meaningful market comparison. Here is more information on how the data is collected. With this new information available in the GRESB Assessment Portal, GRESB Investor Members can now review the ESG disclosure level of the entire FTSE EPRA / NAREIT Developed Index and GPR 250 Index. They can see which REITs and property companies are the most transparent about their ESG performance, which fall into the mid-range and which are behind the curve. And, crucially, they can exploit these differences in the market. 2017 GRESB Real Estate Assessment participants are more transparent about their ESG commitments and performance than companies that do not participate in the GRESB Assessment. Half of GRESB participants (49.7%) have an A-level disclosure, while only 4.3% disclose at an E-level. ESG disclosure is significantly less established in the wider listed universe. 53.3% of companies that did not participate in the 2017 Assessment have an E-level disclosure, while only 3.6% have an A-level disclosure. The data shows that more improvements are needed by listed property companies and REITs if they are to respond to growing investor demand for transparency on ESG performance.

To date, 34 states and DC have enacted PACE enabling legislation and 19 states have active commercial PACE program(s). PACE permits commercial properties to obtain long-term, fixed interest rate financing for the installation of energy efficient, renewable energy and water conservation measures. PACE financing is repaid through a special assessment as part of the property tax collection process. PACE is particularly attractive for commercial property owners for a number of reasons, including (i) extended term – up to 20 years; (ii) transfers with the sale of the property to new owner, who continues to benefit from the energy savings; (iii) off-balance sheet financing; and (iv) in certain leases structures, tenant pays the increased property taxes which are offset by tenant’s reduced utility and operation costs. This session will outline the potential opportunities REITs can realize by utilizing PACE in eligible markets. Such benefits include: 100% financing for capital-intensive improvements with no personal guarantees Lower energy costs resulting in cash flow positive projects Owner retains all tax and utility incentives Improve asset value and accelerate sustainability goals Learning Objectives Moderator Dan Winters, Head of Americas, GRESB Speakers [accordion tag=h6] [accordion-item title=”Brian McCarter, CEO, Sustainable Real Estate Solutions, Inc” state=closed] Brian McCarter is CEO of Sustainable Real Estate Solutions, Inc.

Amsterdam – (Sept. 27, 2017) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, today released the results of the second GRESB Infrastructure Assessment. The 2017 Infrastructure Assessment tracks the progress that has been made since the inaugural assessment conducted in 2016, and paints a picture of ESG performance of the infrastructure sector across 24 countries and 25 sub-sectors (including ports, airports, toll roads, telecommunication, conventional and renewable energy, and social infrastructure). The Assessment was founded by 10 leading institutional investors in late 2015, who remain members of GRESB’s Infrastructure Advisory Board. The Assessment provides the transparency investors need to better manage ESG risks, and provides infrastructure fund managers, companies and asset operators with ESG data and analytical tools to improve their ESG performance. The Assessment has two complementary components: A Fund Assessment and an Asset Assessment. Participation in the Infrastructure Fund Assessment and Asset Assessment increased by 25% and 19% respectively, to cover a total of 224 reporting entities. The Fund Assessment focuses on management and investment processes, addressing foundational ESG plans and policies, leadership and accountability, engagement strategies and communications processes. The 2017 GRESB Score, which is an overall measure of ESG performance, increased 55% to 51 (out of 100) in the Fund Assessment, signalling not only improved performance but also wider asset coverage. The Asset Assessment addresses asset-level plans and policies, implementation actions and operational performance. The 2017 GRESB Score in the Asset Assessment improved by 54% to 43 (out of 100). The improvement is strongest for ESG Management & Policies, with scores for Implementation & Measurement coming in lower. I am very encouraged to see the significant progress made by the Infrastructure sector in participation and ESG-performance. With coverage across 24 countries and 25 sub-sectors, GRESB Infrastructure is rapidly becoming the global ESG benchmark for the sector,” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB. “The sector significantly improved ESG-performance across all GRESB Aspects of the Asset Assessment. While ESG communication and disclosure practices largely increased in 2017, there is still room for improvement, especially when compared with the higher levels of public disclosures made by the real estate sector.” I am very encouraged to see the significant progress made by the Infrastructure sector in participation and ESG-performance.

(GBCI) and GRESB board member. “The GRESB Infrastructure Assessment is helping investors make investment decisions, while also helping the infrastructure industry see an economic benefit through the tracking of ESG data and metrics.” Sustainable infrastructure is a major driver of economic growth and a key to reducing environmental impact,” said Mahesh Ramanujam, president & CEO, Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) and GRESB board member. “The GRESB Infrastructure Assessment is helping investors make investment decisions, while also helping the infrastructure industry see an economic benefit through the tracking of ESG data and metrics.” Double digit growth in participation rates for both the Fund Assessment and the Asset Assessment. The average GRESB Score, an overall measure of ESG performance, shows strong improvements for both the Fund Assessment and the Asset Assessments. Despite the fact that 88% of infrastructure funds and 91% of infrastructure assets collect ESG data, reporting on ESG performance is not yet common practice. ESG screening of pre-investments is increasing, but tracking of actual ESG performance is still not widely implemented. The most notable improvements in the Asset Assessment score are for ESG Management and Policies, with scores for Implementation & Measurement coming in lower. The average GRESB Asset score varies considerably between different asset sectors, with airports emerging as the best performing sector with an average GRESB Asset score of 56.3.

Amsterdam – (Sept. 21, 2017) – GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, today released the results of the 2017 GRESB Real Estate Assessment for the Asian real estate sector. Globally, a record 850 property companies and real estate funds completed the Assessment, representing 77,000 assets and over USD 3.7 trillion in value. The average GRESB Score increased to 63 points, up 3 from 2016. Listed property companies continue to outperform private entities, and entities focused on offices outperform other property types. The new GRESB data shows tangible improvements in environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance. Globally in 2017 the sector: Reduced like-for-like energy consumption by 1.1% – equivalent to 79,827 U.S. homes, Reduced like-for-like carbon emissions by 2.2% – equivalent to 113,000 passenger cars, Reduced like-for-like water consumption by 0.5% – equivalent to 999 Olympic swimming pools, and Diverted 52.9% of landfill waste – equivalent to 399,008 truck loads. The results show that the energy improvements made in recent years by the global real estate sector are in line with the energy reductions targets as set out in the United Nations-supported Sustainable Development Goals. “We are delighted to see an increase in the number of participants and assets across all regions for eight consecutive years. It’s encouraging that, once again, GRESB participants were able to lower energy, water and carbon emissions. We hope that the commitment and meaningful actions taken by the 850 GRESB participants serve as an example to others and help to drive improved sustainability performance more broadly across the market.” says Sander Paul van Tongeren, Co-Founder and Managing Director at GRESB “We are delighted to see an increase in the number of participants and assets across all regions for eight consecutive years.

The region’s performance improved again this year, currently standing at an average GRESB Score of 63 – matching the global average. Most notable improvements were made on the aspects of Policy & Disclosure, Risks & Opportunities, and Stakeholder Engagement. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, adds: “This year’s results for the Asian real estate sector show that sustainability is increasingly being integrated with business strategy and execution, supporting the region’s efforts to create healthy working environments, efficient buildings, and sustainable and resilient communities and cities. This positive transformation is being driven by investors. They are not just requiring companies and funds to list ESG-related risks, but they are expecting them to explain how they’re managing these risks. This way, they can determine if both performance and the commitment to improve is in line with their strategies.” “The most important challenge for further improvements in Asia is a change in mindset.” Langbroek explains: “The pace of improvement may be mediated by factors such as short-termism, and limited insight into the added value of sustainable buildings and portfolios. Stakeholders are expected to incorporate a long-term, holistic view on sustainability in order to establish a timely transition to a net zero carbon built environment.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, adds: “This year’s results for the Asian real estate sector show that sustainability is increasingly being integrated with business strategy and execution, supporting the region’s efforts to create healthy working environments, efficient buildings, and sustainable and resilient communities and cities.

This represents a 27% increase in participant numbers, making Australia/New Zealand the fastest growing region for GRESB participation. For the seventh year in succession, companies and funds based in Australia and New Zealand outperformed all other regions. In 2017, the region achieved an average GRESB Score of 73, compared with a global average of 63. However, the Australia/New Zealand score is stabilizing and the gap between the regions is narrowing. Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, explains: “Investor demand for transparency will further enhance how ESG-related risks are managed by Australian and New Zealand property companies and fund managers, empowering them to adopt leading sustainability practices. Looking at the results, the region is already performing at a high standard. We see that 94% of regional companies and funds that reported to GRESB are already disclosing their sustainability performance to stakeholders. There is a strong focus on social and governance aspects; 97% have a policy on diversity and equal opportunities, 94% include sustainability-specific requirements in their lease contracts with tenants, while 89% have a community engagement program in place.” Mr. Langbroek continues: “The vast majority has taken actions to improve energy and water efficiency of their buildings, while reducing waste streams. However, there is still room for further improvement in reducing the environmental footprint of the sector. Increased commitment from Australia policymakers is equally important, as it provides a clear incentive to advance to a net-zero carbon built environment.” Ruben Langbroek, Head of Asia Pacific at GRESB, explains: “Investor demand for transparency will further enhance how ESG-related risks are managed by Australian and New Zealand property companies and fund managers, empowering them to adopt leading sustainability practices.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/announcing-investor-confidence-project-icp-for-industry-street-lighting-and-district-energy/,"Announcing: Investor Confidence Project (ICP) for industry, street lighting and district energy","AMSTERDAM – (July 3, 2017) – The Investor Confidence Project (ICP) is being extended in Europe to cover energy efficiency projects for industry, street lighting and district energy. ICP is a framework for standardizing how energy efficiency projects are developed and how energy savings are calculated in order to make projects more attractive to investors and building owners. It’s backed up by the Investor Ready Energy Efficiency™ (IREE) Certification that provides third party verification by credentialed Quality Assurance providers that a project has followed the ICP Energy Performance Protocols and originates from a credentialed Project Developer. The ICP Energy Performance Protocols adopted by IREE-certified projects reference best practice project standards to be used in industry, district energy schemes and street lighting upgrades. These protocols allow for the standardisation of project origination, thus reducing transaction costs and improving project performance. This will lead to more projects completed and for greater impact. “Since 2015, with the strong support of the European Commission, ICP has made great progress in introducing standardisation to building energy efficiency projects in Europe,” said Dr. Steve Fawkes, senior advisor, ICP Europe. “With additional support from the European Commission we look forward to extending the principles of ICP into industrial, street lighting and district energy projects.” The expansion will be overseen by the ICP Europe Consortium, which includes EnergyPro Ltd; RdA Climate Solutions in Portugal and Spain; Serimus in Germany; Denskatt in Austria & Bulgaria; and Verco in the UK; as well as Energy Efficiency in Industrial Processes (EEIP) and GRESB, the global ESG benchmark for real assets, who will play a communication role to engage with the European investment market. “We are pleased to see the successful ICP framework being extended into industry, street lighting and district energy.” said Lonneke Lowik, Head of Operations, GRESB. The European Commission published an energy policy update in 2016 citing the ICP Europe protocols as “best practice” to maximize environmental performance in new buildings and investor interest and faith in buildings requiring energy efficiency building upgrade projects. In 2016, Green Business Certification Inc. (GBCI) and the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) announced a strategic vision to work together to develop, deliver and promote the Investor Confidence Project (ICP) as the premier global underwriting standard for energy efficiency projects. ICP joined GBCI’s portfolio of credentials and certifications, which includes the LEED green building rating system, to accelerate investment in energy efficiency.

BREEAM and GRESB are adding a new dimension for 2017 with two new award categories: Leadership in Responsible Real Estate Investment – for the individual that has made the most valuable contribution to driving more sustainable real estate investment, and shown a personal commitment to driving sustainable investment and management within their own organization through the use of building certifications. Corporate Investment in Responsible Real Estate – for the real estate investment company that has made the strongest commitment to the use of building certifications in managing their portfolio. The judging criteria for this award is based on the proportion of total existing portfolio formally assessed and certified under generally accepted building certifications and the level of commitment to drive the achievement of higher rating levels through corporate policies. The winners of the awards will be announced at the BREEAM Awards 2017 for the real estate and construction sectors which takes place on Tuesday, March 7, at the London Marriott hotel.

https://www.gresb.com/nl-en/insights/northern-trust-asset-management-launches-unique-sustainable-real-estate-index-and-fund-in-conjunction-with-gresb/,Northern Trust Asset Management Launches Unique Sustainable Real Estate Index and Fund in Conjunction with GRESB,"LONDON and AMSTERDAM, 19 January, 2017 – Northern Trust Asset Management, collaborating with GRESB, the global sustainability benchmark for real assets, has launched a unique sustainable real estate index. A Dutch-domiciled pooled fund passively managed to this new index has also been launched. The industry-first index is exclusively available to investors using Northern Trust Asset Management vehicles and has been developed in response to demand for a passive approach to real estate investing incorporating environment, social and governance (ESG) factors. “Northern Trust listens to investors and develops solutions to meet their evolving needs. We are delighted to collaborate with GRESB to create this ground breaking index and to launch a fund which tracks the index. This enables passive investors to benefit from the long-term returns associated with listed real estate companies, whilst incorporating sustainable investing principles,” said Hazel McNeilage, managing director for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Northern Trust Asset Management. GRESB is a Netherlands-based investor-driven organization and a leader in the field of sustainable real estate assessment. It is committed to assessing the ESG performance of real assets globally, including real estate portfolios and infrastructure assets. GRESB uses more than 40 specific indicators across seven aspects of sustainability to assess real estate companies. “The environmental performance of buildings has been shown to have a clear link with the underlying financial performance of the assets, and with the risk return profile of property companies or investment funds ultimately owning the assets,” said Sander Paul van Tongeren, managing director of GRESB. “This new fund will, uniquely, allow investors to passively gain exposure to companies that are highly transparent about their ESG performance and reducing environmental and social impact while also incorporating broad geographic and sector diversification.” “The use of GRESB’s ESG data further institutionalizes the important role of environmental, social and governance information in the financial market,” he added. “Northern Trust has long been a pioneer of environmental, social and governance investing, and this first-of-its-kind index fund underlines our approach to identifying ways to continue to innovate and offer our clients market-leading solutions that support their risk return profile and meet their responsible investing needs,” said Mamadou-Abou Sarr, global head of ESG investing at Northern Trust Asset Management. Northern Trust Asset Management offers its clients a broad range of investment management capabilities, across equities, fixed interest and cash management. This includes Engineered Equity, Northern Trust’s approach to factor-based investing and strategies incorporating ESG principles, as well as more traditional index management. Capabilities are available through both commingled funds and segregated accounts, with a focus on designing investment strategies to meet the individual needs of investors.
